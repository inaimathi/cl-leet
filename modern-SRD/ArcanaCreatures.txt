SHADOW CREATURES

SHADOW CREATURES AND THE MODERN WORLD
Humans cling steadfastly to the reality that they wish to be true, resisting every piece of evidence that suggests that the world isn’t the way they believe it to be. Only a relative few make up the “aware minority,” those humans who have experienced a Shadow event and seen it for more or less what it was. The majority, the mundanes, find comfort in translating kobolds with swords into knife-wielding muggers and malicious spirits into tricks of the light. A magical effect might be fireworks or a weather peculiarity. Never underestimate the human mind’s power to deceive itself and maintain a level of comfort.
Those who subconsciously delude themselves do so for the sake of their fragile sanity. Those who know and understand at least some aspect of the Shadow tide maintain the secret to avoid ridicule or investigation, as well as to protect the public illusion of a sane, mundane world.
In addition, since Shadow creatures really don’t belong to this reality, they have a tendency to slowly fade away. Some of them disappear within 1d4 rounds of dying (being reduced to –10 hit points), and none remain in this reality for more than 1d4 hours before the tide of Shadow reclaims them.

SHADOW CREATURE DESCRIPTIONS

Ash Wraith
Ash wraiths speak whatever languages they spoke in life.
They typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall. Because they’re incorporeal, they have no weight.
Species Traits
Ash wraiths have the following traits:
Undead: Undead are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, necromantic effects, and mind-affecting effects. They are not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or effects of massive damage, or any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. They may be healed by application of negative energy (such as an inflict light wounds spell). They are destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points or less.
Incorporeal (Ex): An ash wraith can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It is immune to nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to ignore damage from a corporeal source (except for force effects, such as magic missile, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). It can pass through solid objects at will, but not force effects (such as a wall of force). Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as mage armor) work normally against it.
An ash wraith moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks. It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies both to its melee and ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as blindsight and scent, do not function against an ash wraith. An ash wraith cannot be tripped or grappled by a corporeal attacker.
Burning Touch (Ex): The touch of an ash wraith deals 3d6 points of fire damage, and creatures hit by an ash wraith must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 15) or catch on fire.
Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by an ash wraith’s burning touch is immolated and reduced to a pile of ash that rises as an ash wraith in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the ash wraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
Unnatural Aura (Su): Both wild and domesticated animals can sense the unnatural presence of an ash wraith at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.
Fear of Daylight (Ex): Ash wraiths exposed to natural sunlight are panicked (no save). A panicked ash wraith flees from the sunlight as fast as possible; it can defend normally but cannot attack while exposed to natural sunlight.

Big Cat
Species Traits
Big cats have the following traits:
Pounce (Ex): If a big cat leaps upon a foe during the first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it has already taken a move action.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the big cat must hit with its bite attack. If it gets a hold, it can rake.
Rake (Ex): If a big cat successfully grabs its prey (see Improved Grab, above), it can make two rake attacks (+6 melee) with its hind legs as part of a full attack. Each successful rake attack deals 1d3+1 points of damage.
Scent (Ex): This ability allows the big cat to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
Low-Light Vision (Ex): Big cats can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
Skill Bonuses: Big cats gain a +8 species bonus on Balance checks and a +4 species bonus on Hide, Jump, and Move Silently checks (for running jumps, the Jump bonus is +8).

Ferocity (Ex): Boars are such tenacious combatants that they continue to fight without penalty until reduced to –10 hit points. At –10 hit points, they are slain.
Scent (Ex): This ability allows the wild boar to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
Low-Light Vision (Ex): Boars can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Breathsnatcher
They average 6 feet tall and weigh about 150 pounds.
Species Traits
Breathsnatchers have the following traits:
Clawing Smoke (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a breathsnatcher can expel a 30-foot cone of magic smoke. The smoke grants one-half concealment to creatures in its periphery and full concealment to characters obscured by more than 5 feet of smoke. In addition, any creature within the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or get smoke in their lungs.
Holding one’s breath doesn’t help, as tendrils of smoke actively try to invade the lungs. This magic smoke begins to rip at the lungs and surrounding organs, dealing 3d4 points of damage per round. The affected creature can attempt another Fortitude save each subsequent round to cough out the semivaporous menace.
Snatch Breath (Su): As a full-round action, the breathsnatcher can steal the breath from any adjacent creature with –1 or fewer hit points. This instantly kills the creature and grants the breathsnatcher damage reduction 15/+1 for 1 hour per Hit Die of the victim.
Fast Healing 5 (Ex): A breathsnatcher heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point remaining.

Breathsnatcher: CR 6; Medium monstrous humanoid; HD 9d8; hp 40; Mas 10; Init +3; Spd 30 ft.; Defense 17, touch 13, flat-footed 14 (+3 Dex, +3 natural, +1 equipment); BAB +9; Grap +11; Atk +11 melee (1d4+2, knife) or +12 ranged (2d6, MAC Ingram M10) or +8 ranged (4d6, MAC Ingram M10 burst); Full Atk +11/+6 melee (1d4+2, knife) or +12/+7 ranged (2d6, MAC Ingram M10) or +8/+3 ranged (4d6, MAC Ingram M10 burst); FS 5 ft. by 5 ft.; Reach 5 ft.; SQ clawing smoke, snatch breath, fast healing 5; AL evil; SV Fort +3, Ref +9, Will +9; AP 0; Rep +0; Str 14, Dex 17, Con 10, Int 13, Wis 16, Cha 9.

Celestial
All celestials are outsiders. A sample celestial (the gotthammer) is presented below; use the information about outsiders to create new celestial types.
Species Traits
Celestials have the following traits:
Variable Size: Most celestials are Medium, but their size can vary and some celestials can change their size naturally. Depending on their size, celestials gain a size bonus or penalty on attack rolls, Defense, Hide checks, and grapple checks.
Natural Armor: Celestials gain a natural armor bonus to Defense equal to 3 + the celestial’s Hit Dice.
Immunities (Ex): A celestial is immune to one or more specific types of energy or weapon damage, as determined by rolling on Table: Celectial Immunities, Resistances, and Damage Reduction.
Energy Resistance (Ex): A celestial is resistant to one or more types of energy, as determined by rolling on Table: Celectial Immunities, Resistances, and Damage Reduction. Roll again if the celestial is resistant to a type of energy against which it already has immunity.

Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds the avenging angel. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of a gotthammer must succeed at a Will save (DC 21) or take a –2 morale penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for one day or until they successfully injure the gotthammer generating the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the gotthammer’s aura for one day.
Call/Dismiss Weapon (Su): Once per day, as a free action, a gotthammer may call his shining greatsword to him. The weapon is normally hidden in a secure location of the gotthammer’s choosing, but may be called from anywhere unless carried by another living creature or in an area where magic does not function. Once per day, as a full-round action, the gotthammer may dismiss the sword to a location of his choosing.

Changeling (Template)
Template Traits
“Changeling” is an inherited template that can be added to any Small or Medium humanoid, monstrous humanoid, or outsider (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The changeling uses all all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.
Type: The creature’s type changes to fey.
Hit Dice: Change to d6.
Special Qualities: A changeling retains all of the base creature’s extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like qualities except for qualities tied to its type. In addition to gaining the fey type, a changeling has the following special qualities.
Spell-like Abilities: 1/day—charm person, object reading; 3/day—detect magical aura. The changeling’s manifester level is equal to his or her character level.
Immunities (Ex): A changeling picks one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic/concussion) to which it is immune.
Resistance to Energy (Ex): A changeling gains energy resistance 10 to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic/concussion). A changeling cannot be resistant to an energy type to which it is immune (see above).
Damage Reduction 5/+1 (Su): A changeling ignores the first 5 points of damage dealt by a nonmagical weapon. Unlike sidhe, this damage reduction doesn’t increase as the changeling gains Hit Dice or levels.
Allegiances: A changeling has an allegiance to chaos, but unlike other sidhe, chaos need not be the primary allegiance. This allegiance cannot be broken. 
Ability Scores: A changeling’s ability scores change as follows: Dex +4, Con –2, Cha +4.
Skill Bonuses: Changelings gain a +2 species bonus on Bluff and Sleight of Hand checks.
Feats: As the base creature. Unlike sidhe, changelings do not gain Archaic Weapons Proficiency or Simple Weapons Proficiency as bonus feats.

Demonic Auto
The demonic auto does not speak. It has the normal height and weight of the automobile it most closely resembles. 
Species Traits
Demonic autos have the following traits:
Construct: Demonic autos are immune to mind-influencing effects and to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, necromancy effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. They are not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or the effects of massive damage.
Outsider Traits: While they are technically constructs, demonic autos are animated by a fell presence from beyond Shadow. They gain skills and feats as if they were outsiders, and they have an Intelligence score.
Damage Reduction 20/+1 (Ex): A demonic auto ignores the first 20 points of damage dealt by a nonmagical weapon.
Vehicle Movement: The demonic car moves as a vehicle, not as a character. It has a top speed of 320 squares at character scale (32 squares at chase scale). It maneuvers as a vehicle, using its Drive score, and it must choose a speed category (alley, street, highway, or all-out speed) at the beginning of each action. The demonic auto’s speed category may increase its Defense and penalize skill checks.
No Limbs: The demonic auto has no limbs and thus can’t grapple, nor can it manipulate or throw an object. However, it can open and close its car doors, hood, or trunk rapidly to make a slam attack.
Trample (Ex): The demonic auto can trample smaller creatures by running over them. The demonic auto’s trample attack deals 2d6+9 points of damage if traveling at alley speed and 4d6+9 points of damage at higher speeds. A successful Reflex save (DC 23) halves the damage. The demonic auto takes this damage as well, but its damage reduction applies.
Repairable: Demonic autos cannot heal damage on their own but can be repaired using the Repair skill. A successful Repair check (DC 30) heals 1d10 points of damage, and each check represents 1 hour of work. A demonic auto can repair itself.
Darkvision (Ex): Demonic autos can see in the dark up to 120 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and demonic auros can function with no light at all.

Feats: None.
Advancement: None.

Dragon
All dragons speak their own language, Draconic. They speak a number of additional languages equal to their Intelligence bonus.
Species Traits
Dragons have the following traits:
Age Categories: Dragons have twelve age categories that broadly define most of their statistics, including size, Hit Dice, Defense, attacks, and special abilities. As a dragon ages, it grows more powerful, as defined in Table: Dragon Age Categories.
Breath Weapon (Su): Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can’t breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon’s mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon’s choice, with an area as noted in Table: Dragon Breath Weapon Range. If the breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage; the DC depends on the dragon’s age. Saves against nondamaging breath weapons use the same DC, but aren’t necessarily Reflex saves.
Breath weapons are either cones (which are as high and wide as they are long) or lines (5 feet high and 5 feet wide).
Each dragon has one breath weapon, which is associated with the color of its scales and its allegiance to good or evil.
Fear Aura (Ex): A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet x the dragon’s age category are subject to the effect if they have fewer Hit Dice than the dragon.
A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save (DC noted in Table: Dragon Age Categories) remains immune to that dragon’s fear aura for one day. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the fear aura of other dragons.
Crush (Ex): A flying or jumping dragon of at least Huge size can land on opponents as an attack action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more sizes smaller than the dragon (though it can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks against larger opponents).
A crush attack affects as many cratures as can fit under the dragon’s body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC noted in Table: Dragon Age Categories) or be pinned and automatically take the listed damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take crush damage each round if they don’t escape.
Grappling: A dragon can always use its breath weapon while grappling, as well as its spells and spell-like or supernatural abilities, provided it succeeds at Concentration checks.
If grappled by a creature the same size or larger, a dragon can attack the grappling creature with its bite and all four limbs (each doing claw damage). If crushed by a larger dragon, a dragon can respond only with grapple attacks, or with bite or breath weapon attacks. If grappled by a creature smaller than itself, the dragon can respond with any of its physical attacks other than a tail sweep.
Tail Sweep (Ex): A dragon of at least Gargantuan size can sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affect a half circle with a diameter of 30 feet, centered on the dragon’s rear. A Colossal dragon’s tail sweep has a 40-foot radius.
Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more sizes smaller than the dragon. The sweep deals the damage listed in Table: Dragon Age Categories; a successful Reflex save halves the damage.
Spells: A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a Mage of the level indicated on Table: Dragon Spells and Spell-like Abilities, gaining bonus spells for a high Intelligence score.
Spell-Like Abilities: A young or older dragon gains a spell-like ability upon reaching its new age category, as noted in Table: Dragon Spell-like Abilities. Once the dragon selects a spell-like ability for a given age category, it cannot swap that ability for another. The dragon retains all previously selected spell-like abilities and uses its age category as its caster level. The save DC is 10 + the dragon’s Charisma modifier + spell level.
Spell Resistance (Ex): As dragons age, they become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as listed in Table: Dragon Age Categories.
Immunities (Ex): All dragons are immune to sleep and paralysis effects. Dragons are also immune to certain energy types depending on their color:
Black, green, and copper dragons are immune to acid.
Blue and bronze dragons are immune to electricity.
Red, brass, and gold dragons are immune to fire and take 50% more damage against cold-based attacks on a failed save.
White and silver dragons are immune to cold and take 50% more damage against fire-based attacks on a failed save.
Blindsight (Ex): A dragon can ascertain creatures by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by noticing vibration and other environmental clues) with a range of 30 feet x the dragon’s age category.
Keen Senses (Ex): A dragon has low-light vision and darkvision with a range of 100 feet x the dragon’s age category.

Gear Golem
Gear golems cannot speak. They typically stand 10 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds. A gear golem may be created using the create golem incantation. 
Species Traits
Gear golems have the following traits:
Construct: Gear golems are immune to mind-influencing effects as well as poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, necromancy effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. They are not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or the effects of massive damage.
Speed: Gear golems are lumbering constructs that can’t take run actions.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the gear golem must hit an opponent smaller than itself with its slam attack. If it gets a hold, it attempts to grind its foe against its spinning gears as a free action (see below).
Gear Grind (Ex): If the gear golem successfully grapples a creature smaller than itself, it grinds the creature with its spinning gears for 4d8 points of slashing damage each round the grapple is maintained (including the round in which the grapple is first achieved).
Detonate (Ex): When a gear golem is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it explodes in a 20-foot-radius burst of serrated gears and shrapnel. The explosion deals 12d8 points of slashing damage to creatures caught in the radius; a successful Reflex save (DC 19) halves the damage.
Magic Immunity (Ex): A gear golem is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as follows. An electricity effect slows it (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A fire effect breaks any slow effect on the golem and cures 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. The golem rolls no saving throw against fire effects.
Repairable: Gear golems cannot heal damage on their own but can be repaired using the Repair skill. A successful Repair check (DC 30) heals 1d10 points of damage, and each check represents 1 hour of work. A gear golem cannot repair itself.
Darkvision (Ex): Gear golems can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and gear golems can function with no light at all.

Special Combat Bonuses: Gnomes gain a +1 species bonus on attack rolls against bugbears, goblins (and other goblinoids), and kobolds.

Homunculus
Most homunculi cannot speak, with exceptions noted below. However, the process of creating a homunculus links it telepathically with its creator. It knows what its master knows and can convey to her everything it sees and hears, up to a range of 1 mile. A homunculus never willingly travels beyond this range; if taken beyond the 1-mile range, it loses telepathic contact with its creator and seeks to regain contact at all costs. If a homunculus is slain, its creator immediately takes 2d10 points of damage. If the master is slain, the homunculus is immediately destroyed.
Species Traits
Homunculi have the following traits:
Construct: Homunculi are immune to mind-influencing effects, as well as poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, necromancy effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. They are not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or the effects of massive damage.
Repairable: Homunculi cannot heal damage on their own but can be repaired using the Repair skill. A successful Repair check (DC 30) heals 1d10 points of damage, and each check represents 1 hour of work. A homunculus cannot repair itself unless it has one or more ranks in the Repair skill.
Darkvision (Ex): Homunculi can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and homunculi can function with no light at all.

Creating a Homunculus
Techno Mages have the ability to construct homunculi.  Creating a homunculus requires time, skill, equipment, and various raw materials (including a pint of the creator’s blood) that are consumed during the construction process. Acquiring the necessary equipment and supplies to build a homunculus requires a successful Wealth check (DC 25). Once the necessary supplies are obtained, a Techno Mage must spend 1 week building the homunculus. During this time, the Techno Mage must labor for 8 hours a day. A character not actively working on the ritual must rest and perform no other activities except eating, sleeping or talking. If she misses a day, the process fails, and the ritual must begin anew. At the end of the period, the Techno Mage makes an appropriate Craft check (DC 20). The type of Craft check depends on the nature of the homunculus. A successful check means the procedure has worked. A failed check indicates that the process has failed, although the Techno Mage may start again from scratch. A Techno Mage cannot take 10 or take 20 on the Craft check.
A Techno Mage can create an advanced homunculus with more than 2 Hit Dice (maximum 6 Hit Dice). Each extra Hit Die adds +2 to the purchase DC and +2 to the Craft check DC. 
The Techno Mage may create any number of homunculi. However, when a homunculi perishes, its death deals 2d10 points of damage to the Techno Mage. Homunculi are constructs and, as such, may be stored until needed.

Biochemical Homunculus
A biochemical homunculus is made using the Craft (pharmaceutical) skill and appears as a roughly humanoid wisp of vapor. It can merge with another living being and see through its eyes.
Incorporeal (Ex): A biochemical homunculus can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It is immune to nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to ignore damage from a corporeal source (except for force effects, such as magic missile, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). It can pass through solid objects at will, but not force effects (such as a wall of force). Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as mage armor) work normally against it. 
A biochemical homunculi moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks. It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies both to its melee and ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as blindsight and scent, do not function against biochemical homunculi. A biochemical homunculi cannot be tripped or grappled by a corporeal attacker.
Creature Meld (Su): With a successful melee touch attack, a biochemical homunculus can meld with a living organism of Tiny size or larger and see through that creature’s eyes. It gains none of the host creature’s other senses and exerts no telepathic control over the host creature. If a melded biochemical homunculus is taken more than 1 mile from its creator, it separates from the host creature as a move action and returns to its master with all due haste. If its host creature is slain, the melded biochemical homunculus is immediately destroyed as well.

Digital Homunculus
A digital homunculus is made with the Craft (electronic) skill and resembles a mechanical insect. It has the ability to uplink with electronic devices.
Electronic Interface (Ex): A digital homunculus can attach itself to an electronic device, such as a cell phone or computer, and provide a direct link between the device and its master. Provided the homunculus and its master are within 1 mile of each other, the master can use the homunculus’s interface to operate the device by remote. The homunculus also provides a +2 equipment bonus on its master’s Computer Use and Disable Device skill checks provided it can attach itself to the computer or device through which (or against which) these skills are applied.
The digital homunculus must succeed at a melee touch attack to attach to any device in another creature’s possession. It loses its Dexterity bonus to Defense while connected to a device.

Digital Homunculus: CR 1; Tiny construct; HD 2d10; hp 11; Mas —; Init +2; Spd 20 ft., fly 50 ft.

Flesh Homunculus: CR 1; Tiny construct; HD 2d10; hp 11; Mas —; Init +2; Spd 20 ft., fly 50 ft. (good); Defense 14, touch 14, flat-footed 12 (+2 size, +2 Dex); BAB +1; Grap –9; Atk +1 melee (1d3–2, bite); Full Atk +1 melee (1d3–2, bite); FS 2 1/2 ft. by 2 1/2 ft.; Reach 0 ft.; SQ construct, repairable, darkvision 60 ft., poison, damage reduction 5/+1, fast healing; AL master; SV Fort +0, Ref +2, Will +1; AP 0; Rep +0; Str 7, Dex 14, Con —, Int 10, Wis12, Cha 7.
Skills: Hide +10.
Feats: None.
Advancement: 3–6 HD (Tiny).

Mechanical Homunculus
A mechanical homunculus is made of metal and resembles a miniature robot. It is constructed using the Craft (mechanical) skill. This homunculus has limited artificial intelligence, allowing its master to program it with specific skills.
Darkvision (Ex): The mechanical homunculus has night vision sensors that improve the range of its darkvision to 120 feet.
Acid Spittle (Ex): The bite of a mechanical homunculus injects mild acid that deals an additional 1d6 points of acid damage. The fumes of this acid are not poisonous.
Skills: A mechanical homunculus has 10 skill points, which its master assigns to specific skills when the homunculus is first created. The skill ranks can be assigned only to the following skills: Computer Use, Decipher Script, Demolitions, Disable Device, Knowledge (any), Listen, Navigate, Read/Write Language (any), Repair, Search, Speak Language (any), and Spot. No skill can have more than 5 ranks assigned to it, and all of the skills are treated as class skills. A damaged mechanical homunculus with one or more ranks of Repair can attempt to repair itself or aid another’s attempts to repair it.

Mechanical Homunculus: CR 1; Tiny construct; HD 2d10; hp 11; Mas —; Init +2; Spd 10 ft., fly 30 ft.

Leechwalker
Species Traits
Leechwalkers have the following traits:
All-Around Vision (Ex): A leechwalker can see in all directions at once. Because of this, it gains a +4 species bonus on Search and Spot checks, and it cannot be flanked.
Blood Drink (Ex): A leechwalker can drink the blood of a grabbed victim with a successful grapple check. This attack deals 2d4 points of Constitution damage.
Improved Grab (Ex): If a leechwalker hits an opponent that is its own size or smaller with a tentacle rake attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it successfully grapples, it can use its blood drink ability in the same round. Thereafter, each successful grapple check automatically deals tentacle rake damage and blood drink damage.
Vermin Traits: A leechwalker is immune to all mindaffecting effects. It also has darkvision (60-foot range).
Wounding (Ex): Damage resulting from the leechwalker’s tentacle rake attack is a wound that bleeds for an additional 3 points of damage every round thereafter. Multiple wounds result in cumulative blood loss (two successful rake attacks mean blood lose of 6 points per round, and so on). The bleeding can be stopped by a successful Treat Injury check (DC 10) or the application of a cure spell or some other healing spell. 

Leechwalker: CR 10; Medium vermin; HD 13d8 +39; hp 97; Mas 16; Init +0; Spd 30 ft., swim 20 ft.; Defense 12, touch 10, flat-footed 12 (+2 natural); BAB +9; Grap +13; Atk +13 melee (1d8+4 plus wounding, tentacle rake); Full Atk +13/+13 melee (1d8+4 plus wounding x?2, tentacle rakes); FS 5 ft. by 5 ft.; Reach 5 ft.; SQ All-around vision, blood drink, improved grab, vermin traits, wounding; AL none; SV Fort +11, Ref +4, Will +5; AP 0; Rep +0; Str 18, Dex 11, Con 16, Int —, Wis 13, Cha 7.

Species Traits
Living dumpsters have the following traits:
Construct: Living dumpsters are immune to mind-influencing effects, as well as poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, necromancy effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. They are not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or the effects of massive damage.
Wheels: Because the living dumpster relies on small caster wheels for locomotion, its speed is reduced by half on very soft or soft surfaces such as mud or thick lawns. It can’t negotiate stairs, although it can hop up or down a curb without difficulty.
Wall Smash (Ex): If a living dumpster bull rushes a foe against a wall, it can make a free slam attack against that foe. If the attack succeeds, it deals 2d8+18 points of damage.
Swallow Whole (Ex): If a living dumpster successfully grapples a creature smaller than itself, it can attempt to swallow the creature. If the living dumpster succeeds at a second grapple check, the grappled opponent is swallowed whole. Swallowed characters take 1d8+9 points of damage per round from the vigorous shaking of the living dumpster. The swallowed creature can attack the living dumpster from inside using either its natural weapons or a Small, Tiny, or Diminutive weapon. A living dumpster can hold two Medium creatures (or four Small creatures) at a time.
Darkvision (Ex): Living dumpsters can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and living dumpsters can function with no light at all.

Platonic
A platonic is a powerful entity of Shadow devoted to a particular cause or abstract concept. A platonic is compelled to protect and advance its cause at every opportunity, which often brings it into contact with mortals whose goals are more complex and nebulous.
Platonics can change their appearance at a whim, but most choose to appear as handsome humans of either gender. If they aren’t bothering to disguise their otherworldly origin, their skin has a faint luminescent quality.
Each platonic has an abstract principle to which it is fanatically devoted. Platonics are beholden to what they call the Pact of the Boundless. A series of rules that all platonics follow, the Pact mandates that when possible, platonics won’t reveal their true nature to mundanes. Furthermore, platonics are compelled to act as subtly as possible. 
Platonics naturally speak all languages. They choose their height and weight, but generally pick something within human norms.
Species Traits
Platonics have the following traits:
Aura of Menace (Su): A terrible aura surrounds platonics moved to anger or violence. Any hostile creature within a 20- foot radius of an enraged platonic must succeed at a Will save (DC 17 + platonic’s Charisma modifier) to resists its effect. Those who fail suffer a –2 morale penalty on attacks and saves and a –2 penalty to Defense for one day or until they successfully injure the platonic who generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by that platonic’s aura for one day.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—bestow curse, change self, detect magic, dispel magic, fear, status, telekinesis, teleport. In addition, platonics generally have four additional spell-like abilities (each usable at will) chosen from the spell lists and three spelllike abilities (each usable once per day) chosen from among the incantations. These seven spell-like abilities relate to the platonic’s cause in some way, and they tend to be split evenly between offense, defense, and utility abilities. A platonic’s spell-like abilities are as the spells cast by a 10th-level Mage or Acolyte.
Tongues (Su): All platonics can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a tongues spell cast by a 10th-level caster. This ability is always active.
Extradimensional Storage (Su): Platonics can store up to 50 pounds of gear extradimensionally, sending it away or calling it to hand as a free action once per round. They usually store weapons, cash, and other generally useful goods in this manner.
Keen Vision (Ex): All platonics have low-light vision and 60-foot darkvision.
Immunities (Ex): Platonics are immune to cold, electricity, petrification, and sonic attacks.
Energy Resistances (Ex): Platonics have acid resistance 20 and fire resistance 20.
Damage Reduction 30/+3 (Ex): A platonic ignores the first 30 points of damage dealt by weapons of less than +3 enchantment.
Spell Resistance (Ex): A platonic has spell resistance equal to 10 + Hit Dice.
Fast Healing 10 (Ex): A platonic heals 10 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.
Bonus Feat: Platonics gain the bonus feat Archaic Weapons Proficiency.

Retriever
A typical retriever weighs about 6,500 pounds. It does not speak.
Species Traits
Retrievers have the following traits:
Construct: Retrievers are immune to mind-influencing effects as well as poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, necromancy effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. They are not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or the effects of massive damage.
Eye Rays (Su): A retriever’s eyes can produce four different magical rays with a range of 100 feet. Each round, it can fire one ray, as a free action. An individual ray is usable only once every 4 rounds. It can fire an eye ray in the same round as it makes physical attacks. The save DC for all rays is 10 + 1/2 the retriever’s Hit Dice + the retriever’s Dexterity modifier. The four eye effects are:
Fire: Deals 12d6 points of fire damage to the target (Reflex half).
Cold: Deals 12d6 points of cold damage to the target (Reflex half).
Electricity: Deals 12d6 points of electricity damage to the target (Reflex half).
Petrification: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or turn to stone permanently.
Fast Healing 5 (Ex): Retrievers regain 5 hit points per round. Fast healing stops working when the retriever is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer.
Find Target (Sp): When ordered to find an item or being, a retriever does so unerringly, as though guided by discern location. The being giving the order must have seen (or have an item belonging to) the creature to be found, or have touched the object to be located. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the retriever must hit with its bite attack. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and grips the opponent fast in its mouth. This is how it usually “retrieves” things.

Roach Thrall
Roach thralls learn the dominant human language in their area quickly—generally within a few weeks of emerging from their eggs. They lose the ability to speak if they emerge from their human host, but they still understand any human language they know. In their true forms, roach thralls can wordlessly speak to each other by linking their antennae. In roach form, a roach thrall is about 5 feet long and weighs about 150 pounds.
Species Traits
Roach thralls have the following traits:
Human Host: While inside its human host, the roach thrall can’t use its natural weapons or darkvision. The host body has 10 hit points; if it’s reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, the roach thrall automatically spends a full-round action growing out of the ruined host.
The roach thrall can voluntarily cast aside its host body as a full-round action.
Multiple Limbs: Once they’ve emerged from their human hosts, roach thralls walk upright for a few days before reverting to the gait of a cockroach. This is a preference, not a mandate; the roach thrall can choose whether to be upright or not once per round as a free action. An upright roach thrall has a speed of 30 feet and can use four limbs to attack. Otherwise, it has a speed of 40 feet and can only use two limbs to attack.
Resistance to Massive Damage (Ex): Although roach thralls aren’t vermin, they share some attributes with cockroaches. Roach thralls gain a +5 species bonus on Fortitude saves to negate the effects of massive damage.
Darkvision (Ex): Roach thralls outside of their human hosts can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and otyughs can function with no light at all.
Skill Bonus: The roach thrall living inside a human host gains a +10 species bonus on Disguise checks. It also gains a +5 species bonus on Bluff checks when attempting to pass itself off as its human host.

Dreamghast
Fascinate (Sp): A dreamghast can fascinate onlookers by staring at the targets and speaking softly. The targets must be within 60 feet of the dreamghast and must be able to see and hear the dreamghast. The dreamghast must also see the creatures it intends to fascinate. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. Otherwise, creatures that fail a Will save (DC 21) remain stationary and quiet, staring at and listening to the dreamghast as long as the dreamghast maintains the fascinate effect for up to 1 minute.
Any potential threat (such as a thrall of the dreamghast moving behind the fascinated creature) allows an affected target a new save against the fascinate effect. Any obvious threat, such as drawing a weapon, automatically breaks the effect. While using the fascinate ability, a dreamghast must spend an attack action each round concentrating. The fascinate ability is a spell-like, mind-affecting charm ability.
Despair (Su): The mere sight of a dreamghast in its true form forces the viewer to succeed at a Will save (DC 21) or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that dreamghast’s despair ability for one day.
Detect Dreams (Sp): A dreamghast can observe the dreams of a sleeping creature within 60 feet. This functions like the detect thoughts power manifested by a 10th-level Telepath, except that it only functions on sleeping creatures.
Devour Dreams (Su): A dreamghast can caress the forehead of a sleeping victim and consume its dreams for itself. The process requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted feeding, during which time a cloud or roiling vapor emerges from the victim’s head and is sucked into the dreamghast’s gaping maw. Once the dream is devoured, the dreamghast gains a +1 luck bonus on attacks, ability checks, skill checks, and saves and 4 temporary hit points per Hit Die of the victim. The luck bonus and temporary hit points last for 24 hours. At the end of the dream-eating process, the dreamghast chooses whether it wants to enslave the victim or cause memory loss (see below); either is a free action. A sleeping victim has no chance of waking during the dream-devouring process.
Enslave (Su): If the dreamghast considers a dream-eating victim particularly interesting or useful, he may implant a series of enslavement commands in the victim’s mind. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC 21) or be affected as though by a domination power manifested by a 10th-level Telepath. The dreamghast commands the enslaved victim telepathically when the victim sleeps; when the victim is awake, it acts on previous orders but can’t be given new ones. An enslaved creature obeys the dreamghast’s commands until freed by a dispel magic or remove curse spell or a negate psionics power. The enslaved creature can also attempt a new Will save every 24 hours to break free. The control is also broken if the dreamghast dies or travels more than 1 mile from its slave.
Memory Loss (Su): Once the dreamghast eats someone’s dreams, it may consume the subject’s memories as well. The victim must succeed at a Will save (DC 21) or suffer complete memory loss. The victim has no memory of his identity, background, family, friends, and so forth. The memory loss has no effect on languages known, class-related talents, or other class features. The subject temporarily loses all Knowledge skills but retains all other skills. The memory loss persists until the victim receives a break enchantment spell or undergoes 1d6 months of therapy.
Immunities (Ex): A dreamghast is immune to ballistic damage.
Fire Resistance 10 (Ex): Dreamghasts ignore the first 10 points of fire damage dealt by any single attack.

Possessions: Four machetes.
Advancement: By character class.

Faun
Enchanting Music (Su): Music is magical to fauns, and they can create a variety of enchanting effects on listeners with a carefully crafted song. When a faun infuses its song with its fey power, all creatures within a 60-foot spread of the satyr (except other sidhe) must succeed at a Will save (DC 13) or be affected by attraction, as the power manifest by a 10thlevel Telepath. Once per day, the faun can use his music to instead create a lesser domination effect (Will save, DC 15, negates) or mental blast effect (Will save, DC 15, negates) targeted at one specific listener.
It takes the faun a full-round action to use enchanting music. Anyone who successfully saves against the faun’s enchanting music cannot be affected by music from that faun for one day.
Immunities (Ex): A faun is immune to bludgeoning damage, enabling it to survive a barfight unscathed.
Cold Resistance 10 (Ex): Fauns ignore the first 10 points of cold damage dealt by any single attack.
Skill Bonuses: Fauns gain a +4 species bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Perform, and Spot checks.

Skunk Ape
Skunk apes speak their own language, which has no written form. They may read, write, and speak a number of additional languages equal to their Intelligence bonus (if any).
Species Traits
Skunk apes have the following traits:
Stench (Ex): Skunk apes exude a stench reminiscent of rotting vegetation, ammonia, and decay. When frightened or angry, they can intensify this odor such that all creatures within 30 feet of the skunk ape must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 12) or be nauseated for 2d6 rounds. A nauseated creature may take only a single move action per turn and may not perform actions requiring concentration or attention. Skunk apes are immune to their own stench but not to the stench of other creatures.
Woodland Stride (Ex): The oily fur of the skunk ape allows it to pass through any sort of undergrowth (thorn bushes, briars, cranberry bogs, and other overgrown areas) at normal speed.
Darkvision (Ex): Skunk apes can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and skunk apes can function with no light at all.
Bonus Feat: Skunk apes gain the bonus feat Alertness.

Spirit
Species Traits
All spirits have the following capabilities. Particular types of spirits may have additional abilities.
Undead: Spirits are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, necromantic effects, and mind-affecting effects. They are not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or effects of massive damage, or any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. They may be healed by application of negative energy (such as an inflict light wounds spell). They are destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points or less (but may be rejuvenated, as noted below).
Incorporeal (Ex): A spirit can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It is immune to nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to ignore damage from a corporeal source (except for force effects, such as magic missile, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). It can pass through solid objects at will, but not force effects (such as a wall of force). Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as mage armor) work normally against it. A spirit moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks (unless it wished to be heard). It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies both to its melee and ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as blindsight and scent, do not function against an ash wraith. A spirit cannot be tripped or grappled by a corporeal attacker, nor can a spirit make trip or grapple attacks.
Bonuses to Defense: A spirit gains a deflection bonus to its Defense equal to its Charisma modifier (minimum +1). Although it may appear to wear armor and other forms of protection, a spirit receives no natural armor bonus or equipment bonus to Defense.
Corrupting Touch (Su): A spirit that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage. The spirit adds its Dexterity modifier to the attack roll.
Invisibility (Ex): Spirits are naturally invisible but may be detected by spells that detect or reveal invisible creatures and objects. A spirit may reveal itself willingly, but normally does so only during the night.
Rejuvenation (Su): In most cases, it’s difficult to destroy a spirit through simple combat; the “destroyed” spirit will often restore itself in 2d4 days. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a spirit forever is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require use of the Research skill.
Turn Resistance (Ex): A spirit has +4 turn resistance. If a spirit is turned but cannot flee, it is instead destroyed. However, it may still rejuvenate (see above). 
Imprisonment (Ex): Spirits are bound to a particular place. This place is usually a dwelling, building, or similarly contained area. Within this area, they may use their abilities as normal. In addition, some spirits may only be present at particular times (an anniversary of a death, or only between midnight and dawn). They may be released from this imprisonment by particular actions (giving their physical body a proper funeral, restoring a lost or stolen item, getting vengeance on those responsible for their death, and so forth). A spirit may be unaware of the nature of its release, or may be unwilling to divulge those details.
Darkvision (Ex): Spirits can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and spirits can function with no light at all. 
Skill Bonuses: Spirits receive a +8 species bonus on Hide, Listen, Search, and Spot checks. 

Animating Spirit (Poltergeist)
An animating spirit can move and throw objects around. 
Telekinesis (Su): An animating spirit can use telekinesis as an attack action, at will (as a 10th-level Mage). Creatures subjected to the telekinesis attack are entitled to a Will save (DC 15 + spirit’s Intelligence modifier) to resist.

Animating Spirit (Poltergeist): CR 2; Medium undead; HD 1d12; hp 6; Mas —; Init +4 (Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft., fly 30 ft.

Frightful Spirit (Apparition)
A frightful spirit’s twisted features horrify all who behold it. 
Horrific Appearance (Su): Any living creature within 60 feet that views the frightful spirit must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + spirit’s Hit Dice + spirit’s Charisma modifier) or immediately suffer 1d4 points of temporary Strength damage, 1d4 points of temporary Dexterity damage, and 1d4 points of temporary Constitution damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same spirit’s horrific appearance for one day.

Frightful Spirit (Apparition): CR 3; Medium undead; HD 2d12; hp 13; Mas —; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft., fly 30 ft. (good); Defense 12, touch 12, flat-footed 11 (+1 Dex, +1 deflection); BAB +0; Grap —; Atk +1 melee touch (1d6, corrupting touch); Full Atk +1 melee touch (1d6, corrupting touch); FS 5 ft. by 5 ft.; Reach 5 ft.; SQ undead, incorporeal, corrupting touch, horrific appearance (DC 12), invisibility, rejuvenation, +4 turn resistance, imprisonment, darkvision 60 ft.; AL none or varies; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +4; AP 0; Rep +0; Str —, Dex 12, Con —, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 11.

Feat: Improved Initiative.
Advancement: 3–5 HD (Medium); 6–9 HD (Large).

Groaning Spirit (Banshee)
A groaning spirit can panic others with its mournful cry.
Frightful Moan (Su): A groaning spirit can moan as an attack action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + spirit’s Hit Dice + spirit’s Charisma modifier) or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. A panicked creature flees as fast as possible, cowers if unable to get away, and defends normally (but cannot attack). This is a sonic, necromantic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same spirit’s moan for one day.

Groaning Spirit: CR 4; Medium undead; HD 3d12; hp 19; Mas —; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft., fly 30 ft. (good); Defense 12, touch 12, flat-footed 11 (+1 Dex, +1 deflection); BAB +1; Grap —; Atk +2 melee touch (1d6, corrupting touch); Full Atk +2 melee touch (1d6, corrupting touch); FS 5 ft. by 5 ft.; Reach 5 ft.; SQ undead, incorporeal, corrupting touch, frightful moan (DC 14), invisibility, rejuvenation, +4 turn resistance, imprisonment, darkvision 60 ft.; AL none or varies; SV Fort +1, Ref +2, Will +4; AP 0; Rep +0; Str —, Dex 13, Con —, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 12.

Feat: Improved Initiative.
Advancement: 4–7 HD (Medium); 8–12 HD (Large).

Possessing Spirit (Haunt)
A possessing spirit can take command of a living physical body.
Possession (Su): Once per round, as an attack action, a possessing spirit can merge with a living creature and seize control of its body. To use this ability, the spirit must first enter the target’s fighting space; doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
The target can resist the spirit’s attempt at possession with a successful Will save (DC 10 + spirit’s Hit Dice + spirit’s Charisma modifier). If the save succeeds, the spirit is rebuffed and pushed into an adjacent square. A target that successfully saves cannot be possessed by that spirit for one day, and the spirit cannot again enter the target’s fighting space during that time. If the save fails, the spirit vanishes into the target’s body and takes control of it.
A possessed creature gains the spirit’s Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, allegiances, skills, and feats. The possessed creature retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, type, hit points, massive damage threshold, grapple check modifier, fighting space, reach, Reputation bonus, and extraordinary abilities. It loses access to any spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, action points, and mental abilities (including prepared spells and knowledge gained from life experiences). 
While possessing a host creature, the spirit loses its supernatural or extraordinary abilities except for its turn resistance. The possessed creature’s original spirit instantly reinstates itself if the possessing spirit is turned, destroyed, or otherwise dislodged from its host. A possessing spirit can leave its host as a free action, if it so chooses. Any attack that deals massive damage on the host’s body allows the host another Will save to oust the possessing spirit and regain control of its body (whether or not the massive damage Fortitude save succeeds). 

Possessing Spirit: CR 5; Medium undead; HD 5d12; hp 32; Mas —; Init +6 (+2 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft., fly 30 ft. (good); Defense 14, touch 14, flat-footed 12 (+2 Dex, +2 deflection); BAB +2; Grap —; Atk +4 melee touch (1d6, corrupting touch), Full Atk +4 melee touch (1d6, corrupting touch); FS 5 ft. by 5 ft.; Reach 5 ft.; SQ undead, incorporeal, corrupting touch, possession (DC 17), invisibility, rejuvenation, +4 turn resistance, imprisonment, darkvision 60 ft.; AL none or varies; SV Fort +1, Ref +3, Will +6; AP 0; Rep +0; Str —, Dex 15, Con —, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 14.
Skills: Bluff +8, Diplomacy +8, Hide +17, Intimidate +9, Listen +17, Search +17, Sense Motive +8, Spot +17.
Feat: Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative.
Advancement: 6–9 HD (Medium); 10–15 HD (Large).

Weakening Spirit (Fetch)
A weakening spirit draws strength from the bodies of living creatures.
Draining Touch (Su): A living creature wounded by the weakening spirit’s corrupting touch attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + spirit’s Hit Dice + spirit’s Charisma modifier) or suffer 1d4 points of permanent Strength drain. A creature reduced to 0 Strength by a weakening spirit’s draining touch dies and rises as a free-willed weakening spirit 24 hours later.

Weakening Spirit: CR 6; Medium undead; HD 4d12; hp 26; Mas —; Init +6 (+2 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft., fly 30 ft. (good); Defense 13, touch 13, flat-footed 11 (+2 Dex, +1 deflection); BAB +1; Grap —; Atk +3 melee (1d6 plus 1d4 Str drain, corrupting touch); Full Atk +2 melee (1d6 plus 1d4 Str drain, corrupting touch); FS 5 ft. by 5 ft.; Reach 5 ft.; SQ undead, incorporeal, corrupting touch, draining touch (DC 15), invisibility, rejuvenation, +4 turn resistance, imprisonment, darkvision 60 ft.; AL none or varies; SV Fort +1, Ref +3, Will +6; AP 0; Rep +0; Str —, Dex 14, Con —, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 13.
Skills: Bluff +7, Diplomacy +7, Hide +16, Intimidate +7, Listen +16, Search +16, Sense Motive +8, Spot +16.
Feat: Improved Initiative .
Advancement: 5–8 HD (Medium); 9–14 HD (Large).

Squid
Species Traits
Squid have the following traits:
Aquatic: Squid can move in water without making Swim checks, and they cannot drown in water.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the squid must hit with its tentacle arm attack. If it gets a hold, the squid automatically deals bite damage each round the hold is maintained. Squid and giant squid are treated as one size category larger for purposes of determining their grapple check bonus. If a giant squid makes a successful strike with its tentacle rake attack against a target smaller than itself, it can constrict (see below).
Constrict (Ex): A giant squid deals automatic tentacle damage with a successful grapple check against creatures smaller than itself.
Ink Cloud (Ex): Both the squid and giant squid can emit a cloud of jet-black ink as a free action. The squid’s ink cloud fills a 10-foot cube, while the giant squid’s ink cloud fills a 20-foot cube. The cloud provides total concealment, which the squid normally uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is obscured.
Jet (Ex): A squid or giant squid can jet backward once per round as a full-round action. This increases the squid’s speed to 240 feet and the giant squid’s speed to 320 feet.
Darkvision (Ex): Squid can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and squid can function with no light at all. 
Bonus Feats: Normal squid (but not giant squid) gain the bonus feats Weapon Finesse (bite) and Weapon Finesse (tentacles).

Advancement: 13–18 HD (Huge); 19–36 (Gargantuan).

Swarm
A swarm is a collection of Fine or Diminutive creatures (usually creatures of the vermin or animal types, but not always) that acts as a single creature. Swarms include flocks of birds, swarms of bees, writhing nests of poisonous snakes, and any other conglomeration of creatures that tends to move as a solid mass.
A swarm has the characteristics of its original type, except as noted here.
A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Defense. The swarm makes saving throws as a single creature. A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or a cube (if comprised of flying creatures) 5 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet. To attack, the swarm moves into an opponent’s fighting space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same fighting space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the swarm may provoke an attack of opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures. Larger swarms are represented by multiple swarms, or multiple 5-foot squares.
Swarms are presented in a variety of sizes, with a typical example of their type.
Species Traits
Swarms have the following traits:
Swarm: Swarms are not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm takes half damage from ballistic, slashing, and piercing weapons. It is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate) unless the swarm is susceptible to mind-affecting effects. (If it has a mind, it has a single hive mind that can be targeted by a mind-affecting spell, though swarms of vermin are mindless and thus immune to such effects.) A swarm takes a –10 penalty on saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as many evocation spells or grenade-like weapons. If the area effect attack does not allow a saving throw, the swarm takes double damage instead.
A swarm that fails a Fortitude save against massive damage disperses and does not reform until its hit points return to full.
Swarms don’t make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. Some swarms also have acid, poison, blood drain, or other special attacks in addition to normal damage. A swarm’s attacks are nonmagical unless the swarm’s description states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a swarm attack’s damage to 0, incorporeality, or other special abilities may make a creature immune (or at least resistant) to damage from the swarm. Swarms cannot attempt trip or grapple checks, nor can they be tripped or grappled themselves.
Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square and do not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below.
Distraction (Ex): Any intelligent creature vulnerable to a swarm’s damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its fighting space is distracted. The target must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + swarm’s Hit Dice) or become nauseated for 1 round by the intense pain of countless bites, stings, and pinches. A creature that takes no damage from the swarm’s attack is not subject to distraction. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack or do anything else requiring attention or concentration; the only action a nauseated creature can take is a single move action per turn. Even if the target creature succeeds at a Fortitude save, it is still vulnerable to the swarm’s distraction. It is difficult to undertake complex actions while covered by a swarm. Casting or concentrating on a spell requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills requiring patience and concentration (such as moving silently or opening a lock) requires a Concentration check (DC 20). If the check fails, the target creature is unable to complete the action. 
Sentience (Ex): Most swarms have the Intelligence of a single member of the swarm. Sentient swarms have a hive mind. A swarm with a hive mind has a higher Intelligence score but is susceptible to mind-affecting spells as if it was a single intelligent creature. Sentient swarms have skills as a magical beast (2 x?Int score, plus 1 additional skill point per HD beyond 1 HD).

Toxyderm
Species Traits
Regardless of the type of waste that spawned them, toxyderms share the following traits.
Elemental: As elementals, toxyderms are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning. They are not subject to critical hits, flanking, or the effects of massive damage. They cannot be raised from the dead.
Breath Weapon (Ex): A toxyderm has a cone-shaped breath weapon that it can use as an attack action once every 1d4 rounds. The exact length and type of the breath weapon varies depending on the toxyderm.
Engulf (Ex): A toxyderm can engulf creatures at least one size smaller than itself as an attack action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The toxyderm merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the engulfing toxyderm, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 toxyderm’s Hit Dice + toxyderm’s Dexterity modifier) or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent’s choice) as the toxyderm moves forward. Engulfed creatures are automatically considered grappled and take damage from the toxyderm’s slam attack every subsequent round (no attack roll required).
Darkvision (Ex): A toxyderm can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and the toxyderm can function with no light at all.

Chemical Toxyderm
Acid (Ex): The chemical toxyderm is made of an acid that dissolves organic material. With each successful slam, the toxyderm deals 2d6 points of acid damage in addition to normal slam damage. A creature continues to take acid damage each round until the acid is rinsed off with water.
Breath Weapon (Ex): The chemical toxyderm breathes a 50-foot cone of acid that deals 15d6 points of damage, or half damage if a Reflex save succeeds (DC 10 + 1/2 toxyderm’s Hit Dice + toxyderm’s Constitution modifier). Unlike the garbage toxyderm, the chemical toxyderm takes no damage from its own breath weapon.

Garbage Toxyderm
Disease (Ex): Hantavirus—slam. Fortitude save (DC 14) negates; incubation period 1 day; initial damage 1d2 Str; secondary damage 1d2 Str (temporary or permanent) and 1d2 Con (temporary or permanent).
Breath Weapon (Ex): The garbage toxyderm can expel some of its mass in a 50-foot cone. This deals 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage, or half damage if a Reflex save succeeds (DC 10 + 1/2 toxyderm’s Hit Dice + toxyderm’s Constitution modifier). Each time the toxyderm uses its breath weapon, it takes 20 points of damage. Furthermore, any creature that takes damage from the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or contract a disease (see above).

Nuclear Toxyderm
Radiation (Ex): The area within a quarter-mile of a nuclear toxyderm is considered highly irradiated (see Radiation Sickness, below), so characters receive a low exposure to radiation if they remain in the area for less than a minute and a moderate exposure if they stay longer. If the nuclear toxyderm hits a creature with a slam attack, that creature receives a severe exposure to radiation.
Breath Weapon (Ex): The nuclear toxyderm’s breath weapon is a 100-foot cone of white-hot nuclear slag and fullspectrum radiation. It deals 20d6 points of damage to all in its path, or half damage if a Reflex save succeeds (DC 10 + 1/2 toxyderm’s Hit Dice + toxyderm’s Constitution modifier). Any creature that takes damage from the cone also suffers a high exposure to radiation (see the Radiation Sickness).
Chain Reaction (Su): If the nuclear toxyderm is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it explodes in a blinding flash of light that deals 400 points of damage to everything (creatures and objects alike) within 400 feet and 100 points of damage to everything within a mile; a successful Reflex save halves the damage (DC 10 + 1/2 toxyderm’s Hit Dice + toxyderm’s Dexterity modifier). This explosion generally results in a milehigh mushroom cloud and a highly radioactive crater a quarter-mile across.

Radiation Sickness
When characters are exposed to radiation, they may be afflicted with radiation sickness. Radiation sickness functions exactly like exposure to any other disease, following the normal rules for diseases. The Fortitude save DC and the effects of radiation sickness vary with the dose of radiation to which a creature is exposed.
Radiation exposure has five degrees: mild, low, moderate, high, and severe. To determine the degree of exposure, start with the type of exposure: either an irradiated area or a specific source of radiation. Then consult Table: Radiation Exposure to determine the degree of exposure based on the total time of exposure within a given 24-hour period (rounding up).
The degree of the exposure determines the severity of the radiation sickness, as indicated on Table: Radiation Sickness. At low levels, radiation sickness is a slow disease. Often, a sick character suffers no severe short-term effects. This is reflected in the fact that even with a failed Fortitude save, the character might not suffer any Constitution loss.

Table: Radiation Exposure Time of ExposureSituation 1 rnd 1 min 10 min 1 hr 1 dayCharacter in irradiated area:Lightly irradiated mild mild mild mild mildModerately irradiated mild mild low low lowHighly irradiated low low moderate moderate moderateSeverely irradiated moderate moderate high high severeCharacter exposed to radiation source:Mildly radioactive materials mild mild low low lowHighly radioactive materials moderate moderate high high severeSeverely radioactive materials moderate high severe severe severe

Urban Wendigo
An urban wendigo is generally 8 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
Species Traits
Wendigos have the following traits:
Rage (Ex): An urban wendigo that takes damage in combat flies into a berserk rage the following round, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. An enraged urban wendigo gains +4 Strength and +4 Constitution, and takes a –2 penalty Defense. The creature cannot end its rage voluntarily.
Rend (Ex): If an urban wendigo hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto the opponent’s body and tears the flesh. This attack automatially deals an additional 2d6+9 points of damage.
Ferocity (Ex): An urban wendigo is such a tenacious combatant that it continues to fight without penalty even while disabled or dying.
Peripheral Invisibility (Su): A side effect of the desolation that created the urban wendigo in the first place, the urban wendigo gains the benefit of invisibility, as the spell cast by a 10th-level Mage. By staying out of the direct, focused vision of city dwellers, the urban wendigo can roam the city unseen. Unlike the invisibility spell, any character looking in the general direction of the urban wendigo and taking an attack action to make a Spot check (DC = the urban wendigo’s Hide check) can see the urban wendigo if the check succeeds. Once a character sees an urban wendigo, that character is immune to its peripheral invisibility for 1 hour. 
Scent (Ex): This ability allows the urban wendigo to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by scent. 
Low-Light Vision (Ex): Urban wendigos can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
Skill Bonuses: Urban wendigos gain a +10 species bonus on Balance, Climb, Jump, and Survival checks.

Vivilor
Vivilors are outsiders who come in response to the summon vivilor spell. Vivilors generally have humanoid shapes, but spellcasters can summon quadupedal or serpentine vivilors if they wish. In addition to their basic statistics, a summoner chooses additional special qualities from Vivilor Menu A or Vivilor Menu B (see below). A spellcaster can substitute two choices on Vivilor Menu A for one choice on Vivilor Menu B, or one choice on Vivilor Menu B for two choices on Vivilor Menu A. 
Vivilors do not speak. However, a vivilor can understand the instructions of its summoner and follows them to the letter.
Species Traits
All vivilors share the following traits:
Darkvision (Ex): A vivilor can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and the vivilor can function with no light at all.
Bonus Feat: Vivilors gain the bonus feat Archaic Weapons Proficiency. However, they generally prefer to use their natural weapons in combat.

Vrock
Species Traits
Vrocks have the following traits:
Spores (Ex): A vrock can release masses of spores from its body once every 3 rounds. The spores automatically deal 1d8 points of damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the vrock. They then penetrate the skin and grow, dealing an additional 1d2 points of damage each round for 10 rounds. At the end of this time, the victim is covered with a tangle of viny growths. A delay poison spell stops the spores’ growth for the duration. Bless, neutralize poison, or remove disease kills the spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial of holy water.
Stunning Screech (Su): Once per hour, a vrock can emit a piercing screech. Every creature within a 30-foot radius must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 vrock’s Hit Dice + vrock’s Constitution modifier) or be stunned for 1 round. 
Dance of Ruin (Su): To use this ability, a group of five or more vrocks join hands in a circle, dancing wildly and chanting. If they dance for 3 rounds, a wave of crackling energy flashes outward in a 100-foot radius. All creature within the radius take 2d20 points of electricity damage (to which vrocks are immune); a successful Reflex save (DC 15) halves the damage. Forcing the vrocks to break the circle stops the dance.
Spell-like Abilities: At will—darkness, detect magical aura, displacement, telekinesis (DC 17). These abilities are as the spells cast by a 10th-level Mage. The DCs are Intelligence-based.
Psionic Abilities: At will—charm person (DC 12), suggestion (DC 14). These abilities are as the psionic powers manifested by a 10th-level Telepath. The DCs are Charismabased.
Summon Vrock (Sp): Once per day, a vrock can attempt to summon another vrock with a 35% chance of success. Summoned vrock return whence they came after 1 hour. A vrock that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour.
Teleport (Sp): A vrock can teleport itself (plus 50 pounds of objects) to a specific destination up to 1,000 miles away. This ability is similar to the teleport incantation  except the vrock cannot teleport other creatures, need not make skill checks to succeed, and does not require any components to activate the ability. The vrock may teleport as a full-round action, at will.
Immunities: Vrocks are immune to electricity and poison.
Damage Reduction 20/+2 (Ex): A vrock ignores the first 20 points of damage dealt by any weapon with less than a +2 magic bonus.
Energy Resistance (Ex): Vrocks have acid, cold, and fire resistance 10.
Spell Resistance (Ex): A vrock has spell resistance equal to 12 + the vrock’s Hit Dice (SR 20 for a normal vrock).
Telepathy (Su): A vrock can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.
Darkvision (Ex): A vrock can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and the vrock can function with no light at all.
Skill Bonuses: Vrocks gain a +8 species bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Wererat (Template)
Wererats retain whatever languages they spoke before they contracted lycanthropy. They are generally 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh 125 to 150 pounds.
Template Traits
Wererat is a template (usually acquired by contracting lycanthropy, but very occasionally inherited when two wererats mate) that can be added to any humanoid creature (referred to hereafter as the character). A wererat uses the character’s statistics and special qualities in addition to those described below.
Challenge Rating: Same as the character +2.
Hit Dice: Same as the character plus the dire rat’s base Hit Dice (1d8).
Speed: Same as the character while in humanoid form. In hybrid or rat form, speed becomes 40 ft., climb 20 ft.
Defense: Same as the character while in humanoid form. In hybrid and animal form, the creature gains a +1 natural armor bonus to Defense. This bonus does not stack with other natural armor bonuses.
Base Attack: Same as the character.
Grapple Bonus: Apply modifiers for Strength and size depending on the lycanthrope’s form.
Attacks: Same as the character while in humanoid form. In hybrid and rat form, a wererat attacks with its bite, dealing 1d4 points of damage plus its Strength modifier.
Special Qualities: A wererat retains all the special qualities of the character and gains the additional special qualities
listed below.
Alternate Form (Su): A wererat can assume rat or hybrid form, but its gear is not absorbed into the new form. The bipedal hybrid form is about 5 feet tall, with a long tail and thin fur. The limbs are human, but the head looks like a rat’s. Changing to or from rat or hybrid form is a move action. Upon assuming either form, the wererat regains hit points as if having rested for a day. A slain wereat reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead. Afflicted wererats find this ability difficult to control. The rare natural wererat has full control over this power.
Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): Any humanoid bitten by a wererat’s bite attack (in rat or hybrid form) must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or contract lycanthropy.
Damage Reduction 15/Silver (Su): A wererat in rat or hybrid form ignores the first 15 points of damage dealt by a nonsilver or nonmagical weapon but takes full damage from silvered weapons or weapons with +1 or better magic bonus.
Scent (Ex): This ability allows a wererat in rat or hybrid form to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
Rat Empathy (Ex): A wererat can communciate with rats in any form and gains a +4 species bonus on Diplomacy checks when influencing a rat’s attitude. A friendly rat understands and heeds simple commands, such “wait,” “watch,” “flee,” and “attack.”
Darkvision (Ex): In their rat and hybrid forms, wererats have darkvision with a range of 60 feet. 
Allegiances: An afflicted wereat gains the law and evil allegiances (displacing other allegiances, if need be). They also generally gain an allegiance to other wererats, although this need not be the primary allegiance. The allegiances to law and evil can be removed only when the wererat has the ability to control the curse of lycanthropy by taking 10 on a Control Shape check.
Saves: Same as the character, with a +2 species bonus on Fortitude and Reflex saves.
Ability Scores: Wererats gain the following ability score increases: Dex +6, Con +2. In addition, they gain the following ability score increase in hybrid form: Str +2.
Skill Bonuses: Same as the character, with a +4 species bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks when in humanoid form. In rat or hybrid form, these bonuses increase to +8. A wererat in rat form also gains 3 ranks in Climb, 4 ranks in Hide, and 3 ranks in Move Silently. 
Bonus Feats: Same as the character. A wererat gains the bonus feat Weapon Finesse (any one eligible weapon) in humanoid form and the bonus feat Weapon Finesse (bite) in rat or hybrid form.
