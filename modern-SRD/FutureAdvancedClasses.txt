Class Features
The following class features pertain to the Ambassador advanced class.
Diplomatic Immunity
Starting at 1st level, if the Ambassador is arrested for a crime, she can make a Diplomacy check to invoke her diplomatic credentials and not suffer the usual legal penalty or punishment. The severity of the crime determines the DC of the Diplomacy check, and how authorities react if the Ambassador succeeds. See Table: Diplomatic Immunity for Diplomacy check DCs based on the severity of the crime.
If one of the Ambassador’s consuls (see the select consul class feature, below) is arrested for a crime and unable to secure her own release, the Ambassador may intercede on the consul’s behalf. One may aid the other’s Diplomacy check.
An Ambassador who routinely invokes the privilege of diplomatic immunity—either on her own behalf or to protect her selected consuls—is likely to be recalled or terminated by those she has sworn to represent.

Information Access
Starting at 4th level, the Ambassador can make Gather Information checks without spending money or making Wealth checks, provided she is dealing with individuals or organizations that are helpful, friendly, indifferent, or unfriendly toward her or those she represents. Dealing with individuals or organizations that are hostile requires the Ambassador to make Wealth checks as usual when using the Gather Information skill.

At 10th level, the Ambassador may appoint a number of individuals equal to her Reputation bonus as “consuls” or “attachés.” These appointed individuals gain all the benefits of the diplomatic immunity, information access, and restricted access class features (described above). The Ambassador may revoke these privileges at any time and appoint replacement consuls as she sees fit. It takes 1d4 hours for an Ambassador to invoke or revoke a consul’s or attaché’s privileges.

Defender Of The Universe
Starting at 2nd level, a Dogfighter applies his Reputation bonus to the die result whenever he spends an action point to modify an attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw made aboard a starship.
Shake, Rattle, And Roll
At 4th level, a Dogfighter learns how rock an enemy starship with weapons fire. The Dogfighter must declare that he is using this ability before making the attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). A starship damaged by the Dogfighter’s attack is shaken for 1 round; all passengers and crewmembers (pilots and gunners included) aboard the shaken ship take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round. A Dogfighter may use this ability once per day at 4th level, twice per day at 7th level, and three times per day at 10th level.
To the max!
At 5th level and beyond, a Dogfighter can coax more thrust out of a ship’s engines, increasing its tactical speed by +500 feet. The Dogfighter must be piloting the ship to increase its tactical speed.
Keep It Together
At 8th level, a Dogfighter can continue to operate a starship even after it has been reduced to negative hit points and has begun breaking apart. The ship may take one move action or one attack action each round. However, the ship cannot be repaired and continues to lose 1 hit point per round, exploding once it reaches its destruction threshold. The Dogfighter and all other personnel aboard the ship are considered shaken, taking a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

Ability Surge
At 2nd level, the Dreadnought can temporarily increase her Strength, but at a penalty to Defense. At 5th and 8th level, she can use this ability more frequently.
The Dreadnought gains a +8 morale bonus to Strength, but takes a –2 penalty to Defense. Activating ability surge is a free action, and the surge lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Dreadnought’s class level. Following the ability surge, the Dreadnought is fatigued for as many rounds as she surged, but may negate this penalty as a free action by spending an action point. The Dreadnought may use the ability surge once per day at 2nd level, twice per day at 5th level, and three times per day at 8th level.
Steamroller
Starting at 2nd level, the Dreadnought does not need to move before making an overrun attempt against an opponent. She also gains a +2 bonus on any trip attack made against an opponent who blocks her overrun attempt.

The Dreadnought must be wearing medium, heavy, or powered armor to gain this bonus.
The bonus increases to +4 at 7th level and +6 and 10th level.
Knockdown
At 5th level and beyond, whenever the Dreadnought is allowed to apply her Strength modifier to damage, she forces the target of her successful attack to make at a Fortitude save (DC = damage dealt) or be knocked prone by the force of the blow.
Heavy Artillery
Beginning at 8th level, a Dreadnought treats all weapons as one size category smaller for purposes of determining whether or not she can wield them in one hand and if they are considered light weapons.

Class Features
The following class features pertain to the Engineer advanced class.
Builder
At 1st level, the Engineer gains the bonus feat Builder.
Improve Kit (+1)
An engineer can use his know-how to upgrade an electrical or mechanical tool kit at no additional cost.
Electrical Tool Kit, Basic: For the cost of a basic electrical tool kit, an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version of the kit that grants a +1 equipment bonus on all Repair checks made to fix electrical devices.
Electrical Tool Kit, Deluxe: For the cost of a deluxe electrical tool k it, an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version that grants a +3 equipment bonus (instead of the usual +2 equipment bonus) on all Repair checks made to fix electrical devices and a +1 equipment bonus on all Craft (electrical) checks.
Mechanical Tool Kit, Basic: For the cost of a basic mechanical tool kit, an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version of the kit that grants a +1 equipment bonus on all Repair checks made to fix mechanical devices.
Mechanical Tool Kit, Deluxe: For the cost of a deluxe mechanical kit, an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version that grants a +3 equipment bonus (instead of the usual +2 equipment bonus) on all Repair checks made to fix mechanical devices and a +1 equipment bonus on all Craft (mechanical) and Craft (structural) checks.
Quick Craft
At 2nd level, an engineer learns how to craft ordinary scratch-built electronic, mechanical, and structural objects more quickly than normal.
When using the Craft (electronic), Craft (mechanical), or Craft (structural) skill to build an ordinary scratch-built item, the Engineer reduces the building time by one-quarter.
At 5th level, the Engineer reduces the building time of ordinary objects and mastercraft objects by half.
Superior Repair
At 2nd level, an Engineer learns improved ways of repairing robots, vehicles, mecha, starships, and cybernetic attachments.
An Engineer with a mechanical tool kit and an appropriate facility (a workshop, garage, or hangar) can repair damage to a robot, vehicle, mecha, starship, or cybernetic attachment. (Without a mechanical tool kit, the Engineer takes a –4 penalty on the Repair check.) With 1 hour of work, the engineer can restore a number of hit points based on his Repair check result, as shown in Table: Superior Repair. If damage remains, the Engineer may continue to make repairs for as many hours as needed to fully repair the damaged robot, vehicle, mecha, starship, or cybernetic attachment.
Table: Superior RepairRepair Check ResultDamage RepairedLess than 20None20–292d6 + Engineer class level30–393d6 + Engineer class level40+4d6 + Engineer class levelBonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Engineer gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Engineer must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.
Aircraft Operation (spacecraft), Builder, Cautious, Gearhead, Mastercrafter, Salvage, Surface Vehicle Operation, Vehicle Expert, Zero-G Training.
Improve Kit (+2)
At 4th level, the Engineer can assemble mastercraft (+2) electrical and mechanical tool kits. This ability works as the 1st-level improve kit class feature, except the equipment bonuses improve by an additional +1.
Reconfigure Weapon
At 4th level, an Engineer can reconfigure a melee or ranged weapon, improving one aspect of it. Reconfiguring a weapon requires 1 hour of work and a successful Repair check (DC 20); reconfiguring a mastercraft weapon is slightly harder (DC 20 + the weapon’s mastercraft bonus feature). An Engineer may take 10 or take 20 on this check.
The reconfiguration imposes a –1 penalty on attack rolls made with the weapon but grants one of the following benefits indefinitely:
Changed Rate of Fire: The reconfiguration changes the weapon’s rate of fire. A semiautomatic-only weapon switches to an automatic-only weapon, or vice versa. This benefit applies only to a ranged weapon with either a semiautomatic or automatic fire setting.
Greater Ammo Capacity: The reconfigured weapon can hold 50% more ammunition than normal. This benefit applies only to weapons that take ammunition.
Greater Concealment: The reconfiguration grants a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal the reconfigured weapon.
Greater Range Increment: The reconfigured weapon’s range increment increases by 10 feet. This benefit applies only to weapons with range increments.
Signature Shooter: The weapon is reconfigured for a single individual’s use only and is treated as a unique exotic weapon. Anyone else who uses the weapon takes a –4 nonproficient penalty on attack rolls.
Weapons can be reconfigured multiple times; each time a weapon is reconfigured, it imparts a new benefit. Undoing an Engineer’s weapon reconfiguration requires 1 hour and a successful Disable Device check (DC 20 + the Engineer’s class level).
Sabotage
At 4th level and beyond, the Engineer can sabotage an electrical or mechanical object so that it operates poorly. The Engineer must succeed on a Disable Device check (DC 20) to accomplish the downgrade, and sabotaging a mastercraft object is slightly harder (DC 20 + the mastercraft object’s bonus feature). Noticing the Engineer’s handiwork without first testing the sabotaged device requires a successful Search check (DC = the Engineer’s Disable Device check result). Fixing the sabotaged item requires a successful Repair.
Sabotage Device: As a full-round action, the Engineer can reconfigure a device with electrical or mechanical components so that anyone who uses it suffers a penalty equal to the Engineer’s class level on skill checks made to use the device.
Sabotage Weapon: As a full-round action, the Engineer can sabotage a weapon so that it misfires or breaks the next time it is used. A sabotaged weapon cannot be used effectively until repaired. This use of sabotage also applies to vehicle and starship weapons.
Craft XP Reserve
Starting at 5th level, an Engineer with the Mastercrafter feat can build mastercraft electronic and mechanical devices without investing as much of himself in the process.
At 5th level and every level thereafter, an Engineer gains a special reserve of experience points equal to 100 × his Engineer class level. These extra experience points are separate from experience gained through level advancement and can only be used to make mastercraft items; they do not count toward level gain.
An Engineer must spend the extra experience points he gains at each level, for when the Engineer gains a level, he loses any unspent experience points in his reserve.
Improve Kit (+3)
At 7th level, the Engineer can assemble mastercraft (+3) electrical and mechanical tool kits. This ability works as the 4th-level improve kit class feature, except the equipment bonuses improve by an additional +1.
Quick Fix
At 7th level, the Engineer can repair a mechanical or electrical device in half the normal time; see the Repair skill description for normal repair times. However, cutting the repair time increases the Repair check DC by 5.
Weapon Upgrade
At 8th level, an Engineer can upgrade handheld or robot-installed weapons, as well as weapon systems aboard vehicles, mecha, or starships.
Table: Weapon Upgrade	Handheld/Robot Weapon Upgrade DCWeapon also dazes target for 1 round 25Weapon also knocks target prone 30Weapon leaves target shaken for 1d4 rounds 35Weapon also stuns target for 1d4 rounds 40Vehicle/Mecha/Starship Weapon Upgrade DCWeapon deals an extra two dice of damage 25Weapon ignores 5 points of target’s hardness/DR 30Weapon’s critical hit multiplier increases by 1 35Weapon ignores 10 points of target’s hardness/DR 40The Engineer must spend 1 hour tinkering with the weapon, after which he must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check. The DC varies depending on how the weapon is modified, as shown in Table: Weapon Upgrade. If the skill check fails, the attempt to modify the weapon also fails, although the Engineer may try again. (The engineer may take 20 on the skill check, but the upgrade takes 20 hours to complete.) An upgraded weapon has a 10% chance of breaking after each time it is used; it cannot be used again until repaired, and repairing it requires 1 hour and a successful Repair check (DC 40).
Unflustered
A 10th-level Engineer can perform complicated tasks without provoking attacks of opportunity from adjacent foes.
During any round in which the Engineer uses the Computer Use, Craft, Demolitions, Disable Device, or Repair skill, he can first make a Concentration check (DC 15) to use the desired skill without provoking attacks of opportunity. Making the Concentration check doesn’t cost the Engineer an action. He may take 10 on the Concentration check, but he cannot take 20.

EXPLORER

Requirements
To qualify to become an Explorer, a character must fulfill the following criteria.

Survivalist
At 1st level, the Explorer gains the bonus feats Guide and Track.
Resolve
Beginning at 2nd level, an Explorer gains a morale bonus equal to one-half her Explorer class level (rounded down) on saving throws to resist fear effects and Intimidate checks.
Skilled Searcher
When actively searching for secret doors or traps, an Explorer of 2nd level or higher gains a bonus on her Search checks equal to one-half her Explorer class level (rounded down).

These bonuses rise to +2 at 7th level and +3 at 10th level.
Extra Step
An Explorer of 5th level or higher can spend an action point to take an extra 5-foot step during her turn, as a free action. This extra 5-foot step does not provoke attacks of opportunity. 
At 10th level, the Explorer can take the extra 5-foot step without spending an action point.
Explorer’s Evasion
If an Explorer of 8th level or higher is exposed to any effect that normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, the Explorer suffers no damage if she makes a successful saving throw. If the Explorer already has evasion, she gains improved evasion instead. Improved evasion works similar to evasion, except the Explorer suffers only half damage on a failed saving throw.

A Field Officer cannot use this ability on himself.
Uncanny Survival
Beginning at 2nd level, a Field Officer can add one-half his class level to his Defense for 1 round, once per day. (The bonus applies to the Field Officer’s touch and flat-footed Defense, as well.) He must declare he is doing this at the beginning of his turn, and the Defense bonus lasts until his next round of actions.
Bonus Feats 
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Field Officer gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Field Officer must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.
Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Armor Proficiency (light), Armor Proficiency (medium), Armor Proficiency (heavy), Armor Proficiency (powered), Combat Expertise, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Mobility, Precise Shot, Quick Draw, Renown, Shot on the Run.
Tactical Expertise
Starting at 4th level, as a full-round action, a Field Officer can use his tactical knowledge to coordinate allies. Allies to be affected must be within sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer and must be able to understand him.
The Field Officer must make a Knowledge (tactics) check with a DC equal to 15 + the number of allies affected. He cannot take 10 or take 20 on the check. If the check succeeds, all affected allies gain a competence bonus on attack rolls or a dodge bonus to Defense equal to the Field Officer’s Reputation bonus. The Field Officer chooses which of the two benefits to impart and must impart the same benefit to all affected allies. The benefits last for 1 round.
If the check fails, the Field Officer’s allies gain no benefit, but the action is still spent.
A Field Officer cannot apply the benefits of this ability to himself.
August Leadership
The Field Officer gains this ability at 5th level. It works like the leadership ability (see above), except the Field Officer adds his Charisma bonus and his Reputation bonus to the ally’s skill check.
Tactical Mastery
At 7th level, the Field Officer requires less time to direct his allies. This ability is similar to tactical expertise (see Tactical Expertise, above) but requires an attack action instead of a full-round action.
Commanding Presence
At 8th level and beyond, a Field Officer can use an attack action and his commanding presence to enable an ally or weaken a single foe’s resolve.
Enabling an ally requires an attack action and a successful Diplomacy check (DC 20). If the check succeeds, the Field Officer can negate any one of the following harmful conditions affecting a single ally: cowering, dazed, fatigued, nauseated, panicked, shaken, or stunned. The ally to be affected must be within sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer and must be able to understand him.
The Field Officer cannot use this ability on himself.
Weakening a foe’s resolve requires an attack action and a successful Intimidate check (DC = target’s level check) . If the check succeeds, the target is shaken for a number of rounds equal to 1d6 + one-half the Field Officer’s class level + the Field Officer’s Charisma modifier. The target must be within sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer and must be able to understand him. A target that resists the Field Officer’s attempt to weaken its resolve is immune to the Field Officer’s use of this ability for 24 hours.
Action Trust
At 10th level, the Field Officer’s mere presence inspires, safeguards, and motivates his allies.
As a free action, a Field Officer may spend one of his action points to modify an ally’s attack roll, skill check, ability check, level check, or saving throw result by +2d6 (applying a bonus of +2 to +12).
The ally to be affected must be within sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer to gain the benefits of the Field Officer’s spent action point. A Field Officer may use this ability once per round, and not on himself (he gains the normal benefits for spending an action point on himself).
Any character may transfer some or all of her action points to the Field Officer as a free action. The Field Officer must consent to the transfer, and these action points become the Field Officer’s to spend as he sees fit.

Class Features

Xenolore
A Xenophile can make a Knowledge check to identify certain characteristics of a xenomorph, including any special attacks, special qualities, or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of the Knowledge check equals 10 + the xenomorph’s Hit Dice. A successful check allows the Xenophile to unlock a single fact about the xenomorph. For every 5 points by which her check result exceeds the DC, the Xenophile learns another piece of useful information.
The type of Knowledge check depends on the xenomorph’s creature type, as shown below:
Knowledge (arcane lore): Fey, magical beasts.
Knowledge (earth and life sciences): Aberrations, animals, dragons, elementals, giants, humanoids, monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants, vermin.
Knowledge (technology): Constructs.

Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.

In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one xenotype (including the one just selected, if desired) increases by 2. A Xenophile who chooses humanoids as a xenotype must also specify a particular species.
