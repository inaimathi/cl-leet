CYBERNETICS

EVOLUTION OF CYBERNETICS
As with all forms of technology, advancements in cybernetics can be tracked by Progress Level.
Progress Level 5: Cybernetics is still in its formative stage. Most prosthetic units are of the nonpowered variety, but medical associations have approved certain electronic regulators for life-threatening conditions. The artificial heart is the most recognized example. Other common examples include pacemakers, artificial kidneys, and pancreas monitors (for high-risk diabetics). Nearly all PL 5 cybernetic attachments are simply designed to keep their recipients alive and reasonably healthy. 
Elective cybernetics begins at this stage with the work of university professor Kevin Warwick, who develops methods of linking computer microchips to the human nervous system. His “cyborg chip” becomes the foundation for all future cybernetic components.
Progress Level 6: This era sees the first use of independently powered cybernetics, including servolimbs and subcutaneous cellular telephones. These begin mostly in military applications but soon become available to the public. Household pets all over the world are implanted with subcutaneous identity chips—as are important government figures and their families—after the technology proves safe and effective on prison inmates.
As cybernetics is still new and can have negative side effects, its adoption is not universal. Most people still prefer mundane equipment, which is generally cheaper, safer, and less troublesome to repair, replace, or upgrade. Cybernetics becomes the preferred choice only when mundane equipment is impractical or unavailable— or when the recipient is fixated on self-improvement.
Medical plans eventually come to offer at least baseline prosthetics to compensate for disabling injuries, such as the loss or partial loss of a limb, though such plans do not cover elective cybernetic surgery. Their concern is overall health—not “cosmetic” enhancement. For those who want more than just replacements, a new kind of clinic appears, offering cybernetic enhancements.
At this Progress Level, the first cybernetic regulation laws are passed—largely instigated by a few harshly publicized accidents involving cyborgs. These laws give rise to numerous black-market cybernetic clinics that install cybernetics without performing the required background checks.
Progress Level 7: By this era, cybernetics has become a mostly safe science. Flaws in earlier designs have been corrected. Cybernetics becomes more of a status symbol, and luminous skin grafts become the fashion accessory of choice. In some societies, newborn children are implanted with identity chips as an anti-kidnapping measure. Military applications include replacement eyes with heads-up targeting and GPS displays.
Insurance regulations relax considerably toward cybernetic replacements at Progress Level 7; enhancements are perfectly acceptable, though only as part of a prosthetic, rather than as elective cyber-surgery. Still, most cyborgs are members of military or law-enforcement organizations—or mercenaries.
Progress Level 8: Cyborgs are a common sight. In some societies, medical insurance frowns on noncybernetic replacements, as mechanical body parts are less expensive than flesh. Cybernetic technology has improved so much, in fact, that some cyborgs are virtually indistinguishable from living beings—except that they never appear to age.

CYBERNETIC ATTACHMENTS
Two kinds of cybernetic attachments exist: replacements and enhancements.
Replacements: Replacements are prosthetic or artificial units intended to replace lost limbs and damaged organs. Common replacements provide no benefits other than duplicating the essential functions of their biological counterparts, and they present little strain on the beneficiary’s overall well-being. In appearance, a cybernetic replacement can be recognizably artificial or virtually indistinguishable from the real thing.
Enhancements: Enhancements bestow new abilities or improve the recipient in some fashion. Enhancements include skeletal reinforcement, subcutaneous communications hardware, and weapon mounts. Some enhancements have visible external components, while others are hidden beneath the skin. Enhancements put more of a drain on the body’s resources, and recipients frequently suffer debilitating physical or mental side effects.

CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR
Cybernetic attachments are complex instruments with both electrical and mechanical components. Consequently, a character must have the Craft Cybernetics feat to build a cybernetic attachment.
Repairing a damaged or nonfunctional cybernetic attachment requires 10 hours of work and a successful Repair check (DC 25). A character needs both an electrical tool kit and a mechanical tool kit to facilitate repairs. Without one or the another, a character takes a –4 penalty on the check; without both kits, the penalty increases to –8.

INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL
Installing or removing a cybernetic attachment, regardless of whether it’s a replacement or enhancement, requires a successful Treat Injury check. A character with the Cybernetic Surgery feat suffers no penalty on the check.
Removing a cybernetic attachment without proper surgery causes lasting physical trauma to the patient’s body, dealing 1d4 points of permanent Constitution drain.

NUMBER OF ATTACHMENTS
Only living creatures can have cybernetic attachments. In addition, a living creature can have a maximum number of cybernetic attachments equal to 1 + the creature’s Constitution modifier (minimum 0).
A creature may have more cybernetic attachments installed on its body can it can bear. However, the creature gains 1 negative level per cybernetic attachment that exceeds its maximum allowed. For each negative level, the creature takes a –1 penalty on all skill checks and ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and loses one effective level or Hit Die whenever level is used in a die roll or calculation. Further, a character with psionic powers loses the ability to manifest one power of the highest level she can manifest (player’s choice), while a character with spellcasting ability loses the ability to cast one spell of the highest level he can cast. This loss persists until the negative level is removed.
Negative levels caused by having too many cybernetic attachments remain until the offending attachments are removed.

BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS
Cybernetic attachments provide countless benefits to their recipients. For example, cybernetic eyes can bestow darkvision, improve the accuracy of the recipient’s ranged attacks, or emit pencil-thin laser beams. A cybernetic brain implant can improve the recipient’s response time in a crisis, protect against mind-influencing attacks, or increase the flow of adrenaline throughout the body. The possibilities of cybernetic technology are endless. Although the benefits make cybernetics very alluring, the drawbacks are equally discouraging:
ELECTRICITY VULNERABILITY
A creature with one or more cybernetic attachments takes 50% more damage from any attack that deals electricity damage. This vulnerability to electricity can be offset by an anti-shock implant (see Cybernetic Enhancements, below).
NEGATIVE LEVELS
Whenever a creature exceeds its maximum number of cybernetic attachments, it gains negative levels until the excess attachments are removed (see Number of Attachments, above).
SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ATTACK 
External cybernetic attachments are subject to attacks as if they were objects worn by their recipients.
MASSIVE DAMAGE EFFECTS
Massive damage wreaks havoc with cybernetic attachments. Whenever a creature with cybernetic attachments fails a Fortitude save against massive damage, the GM should roll percentile dice and consult Table: Massive Damage Effects to determine what happens.

Table: Massive Damage Effectsd% RollEffect of Failed Fortitude Save01–30Normal Effect31–60Attachment Disabled61–80Normal Effect and Attachment Disabled81–100Attachment Damaged and Side Effect
Normal Effect: The character immediately drops to –1 hit points and is dying.
Attachment Disabled: One cybernetic attachment (determined randomly or chosen by the GM) ceases to function until repaired (see Construction and Repair, above). The character suffers the effects of the disability—as noted in the description of the cybernetic attachment— for as long as the attachment remains disabled.
Attachment Damaged: One cybernetic attachment (determined randomly or chosen by the GM) continues to function but develops an unpleasant side effect that persists until the attachment is repaired (see Construction and Repair, above).
Side Effect: The character suffers a debilitating side effect as the result of a damaged attachment. Various side effects are presented on Table: Side Effects.

Table: Side Effectsd% RollSide Effect01–08Blurred Vision: Character suffers a 20% miss chance on all attacks.09–17Constant Trembling: Character takes a –2 penalty on Dexterity-based skill checks.18–25Cybernetic Rejection: Character suffers 1d4 points of Constitution damage per day.26–34Dizziness: Character takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.35–42Impaired Hearing: Static distortion imposes a –2 penalty on all Listen checks.43–50Impaired Vision: Distorted images impose a –2 penalty on Spot checks.51–59Insomnia: Character can only sleep for minutes at a time and gains insufficient rest to heal naturally.60–67Muscle Cramps: Character moves at half speed.68–76Muscle Fatigue: Character takes a –2 penalty on Strength-based skill checks.77–84Power Surge: Character is shaken for 1 round if wounded; a successful Fortitude save (DC 12) negates.85–93Psychosis: Character suffers 1d4 points of Charisma damage per day, lapsing into a coma if the score drops to 0.94–100Sensory Overload: Character is stunned for 1 round if wounded; a successful Fortitude save (DC 15) negates.
REPLACEMENTS

Restriction: Military (+3).

Laser Optics (PL 7)
The recipient’s eyes are replaced with ocular implants capable of firing thin laser beams.
Benefit: Using laser optics is an attack action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A “laser eye” deals 2d6 points of fire damage, threatens a critical hit on a natural 20, and has a range increment of 20 feet. Each additional eye adds +2 to the damage roll (thus, a pair of laser eyes would deal 2d6+2 points of fire damage).
A creature equipped with multiple laser eyes must fire them simultaneously at the same target.
Type: Internal.
Hardness/Hit Points: –/2 (per eye).
Base Purchase DC: Single 25, pair 28.
Restriction: Military (+3).

Luminous Skin (PL 7)
Special skin grafts create luminous displays on the recipient’s flesh. Most recipients use it purely for decoration, but the same technology can provide a built-in chronometer.
Benefit: The recipient can control the brightness of the luminescence as a free action, negating it entirely if desired. As its most intense, luminous skin can illuminate squares occupied by or adjacent to the recipient. The chronometer serves the same function as a wristwatch, including date, time, and alarm functions.
Type: Internal.
Hardness/Hit Points: –/– (luminous skin ceases to function when the recipient is killed).
Base Purchase DC: 4 (6 for chronometer version).
Restriction: None.

Microcomputer (PL 7)
The recipient has a miniature computer attached to his nervous system, usually at the base of the skull.
Benefit: The recipient may attempt Computer Use checks as a move action, rather than a full-round action. The microcomputer reduces by half the time required to operate remotes. A data port in the back of the unit allows for the insertion of a standard interface cable (purchase DC 5), allowing the recipient to transfer data without the benefit of a modem. 
Type: Internal.
Hardness/Hit Points: –/4.
Base Purchase DC: 35 (36 with integrated cellular modem).
Restriction: Restricted (+2).

Mindscreen Implant (PL 7)
A small implant in the recipient’s brain protects him against mental attacks. 
Benefit: The recipient gains a +2 equipment bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting attacks.
Type: Internal.
Hardness/Hit Points: –/2.
Base Purchase DC: 28.
Restriction: Military (+3).

Prosthetic Enhancer (PL 7)
This implant attaches to a prosthetic arm or leg, making it stronger.
Benefit: If attached to a prosthetic leg, the prosthetic enhancer increases the recipient’s base speed by +5 feet. In addition, any unarmed attack made with an enhanced prosthetic leg deals an additional 1 point of damage.
If attached to a prosthetic arm, the prosthetic enhancer grants a +2 bonus on Strength- and Dexterity-based ability checks and skill checks. In addition, any unarmed attack made with an enhanced prosthetic arm deals an additional 1 point of damage.
A prosthetic enhancer does not count toward the total number of cybernetic attachments the recipient can have before taking negative levels (see Number of Attachments).
Type: Internal.
Hardness/Hit Points: –/2.
Base Purchase DC: 22.
Restriction: None.

Rage Implant (PL 7)
This brain implant dramatically increases the amount of adrenaline and testosterone the recipient’s body produces, temporarily boosting his strength and durability.
Benefit: The recipient can activate the implant as a free action once per day. Upon doing so, he temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a –2 penalty to Defense.
The increase in Constitution increases the recipient’s hit points by 2 per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. While raging, the recipient cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Drive, Escape Artist, Intimidate, Pilot, or Ride), the Concentration skill, any abilities that require patience and concentration (including spellcasting and manifesting psionic powers), or any items that must be activated to function. 
The rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the recipient’s (newly acquired) Constitution modifier. The recipient may prematurely end his rage.
At the end of the rage, the recipient loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued for the remaining duration of the current encounter.
The increased Constitution triggered by the rage implant in now way obviates the negative levels bestowed for having too many cybernetic attachments.
Type: Internal.
Hardness/Hit Points: –/3.
Base Purchase DC: 24.
Restriction: Restricted (+2).

Skill Plexus (PL 7)
This unit, implanted in the recipient’s brain, allows multiple skill implants to function as a single cybernetic attachment (see Skill Implant, above).
Benefit: The recipient may have up to four skill implants attached to the skill plexus, and together they are treated as a single cybernetic attachment. However, if the skill plexus is destroyed, all of the attached skill implants are destroyed as well.
Type: Internal.
Hardness/Hit Points: –/4.
Base Purchase DC: 25 (does not include skill implants).
Restriction: None.

Targeting Optics (PL 7)
The recipient’s eyes are replaced with ocular implants that use a projected targeting reticle to improve the recipient’s aim. All of the recipient’s eyes must be replaced to gain any benefit. 
Benefit: Targeting optics grant a +1 bonus on all attack rolls made with ranged weapons.
Type: Internal.
Hardness/Hit Points: –/2 (per eye).
Base Purchase DC: 17.
Restriction: Military (+3).

Feat Plexus (PL 8)
This unit, implanted in the recipient’s brain, allows multiple feat implants to function as a single cybernetic attachment (see Feat Implant, above).
Benefit: The recipient may have up to four feat implants attached to the feat plexus, and together they are treated as a single cybernetic attachment. However, if the feat plexus is destroyed, all of the attached feat implants are destroyed as well.
Type: Internal.
Hardness/Hit Points: –/4.
Base Purchase DC: 25 (does not include feat implants).
Restriction: Military (+3).

Invisiware (PL 8)
This technology enables its recipient to turn invisible for a short time. Invisiware uses crystalline refractors grafted to the skin and powered by rechargeable solar battery units protruding from various points on the recipient’s body (usually the spine).
Benefit: By using invisiware to bend light around its body, a creature can turn invisible. An invisible creature gains a +40 bonus on Hide checks if immobile, or a +20 bonus if moving. Pinpointing the location of an invisible creature that isn’t attempting to hide requires a Spot check (DC 40 if the creature is immobile or DC 20 if it is moving).
While invisible, the creature gains 50% concealment against attacks from other creatures that correctly pinpoint its fighting space.
Activating or deactivating invisiware is a free action. However, the technology consumes a great deal of the battery power; after 10 rounds (1 minute) of use, the solar batteries must be recharged for 1 hour, during which time the invisiware cannot be activated. 
Type: External.
Hardness/Hit Points: 4/20.
Base Purchase DC: 35.
Restriction: Military (+3).

Psi Implant (PL 8)
This brain implant stimulates neuron activity in underdeveloped regions of the recipient’s brain, unlocking latent psionic abilities.
