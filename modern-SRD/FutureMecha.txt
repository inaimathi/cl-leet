MECHA
Mecha technology can be found in societies of PL 6 or higher.

MECHA BODY SIZE
Mecha bodies come in Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal sizes. A mecha’s size determines how many equipment slots (places where weapons and additional equipment can be installed) it has, and how well it measures up in combat. See Table: Mecha Sizes for a summary of this information.
Size Modifier: Apply this modifier to the mecha’s attack rolls and to its Defense.
Equipment Slots: The number of locations where weapons and other mecha equipment can be installed.
Hit Points: The mecha’s hit points, and the number of hit points the mecha provides its operator.
Base Speed: The mecha’s base land speed. Certain types of armor reduce base speed (see Mecha Armor).
Height: The mecha’s height in feet.
Weight: The mecha’s weight in pounds.
Fighting Space: The mecha’s fighting space.
Reach: The mecha’s reach, even without weapons.
Purchase DC: The base purchase DC of the mecha without armor, weapons, and other equipment.
Restriction: The level of license required to purchase the mecha legally.

LARGE MECHA
Essentially big suits of armor, Large mecha excel in urban battlefields and starship boarding actions, where they move through buildings and corridors to find the enemy. Large mecha are the easiest to operate. However, they can’t carry the intense array of weapons that bigger mecha can, nor are they as strong or durable.
Combat Statistics: A Large mecha adds a +8 equipment bonus to a character’s Strength score. It imposes a –1 size penalty on attack rolls and to Defense. Depending on the material used, a Large mecha has 100 bonus hit points, which are added to the character’s total and subtracted first when the character takes damage. It takes a –4 penalty on Hide checks.
A Large mecha has a single slam attack that deals 1d8 points of damage (plus the character’s increased Strength modifier). Its reach is 10 feet, and its base speed is 30 feet.
Base Purchase DC: 40.
Equipment Slots: A Large mecha has 7 equipment slots available. These slots are located as follows.
Helmet: 1 slot.
Back: 1 slot.
Left arm: 1 slot.
Right arm: 1 slot.

Torso: 1 slot.
Boots: 1 slot.

HUGE MECHA
Common weapons on the futuristic battlefield, Huge mecha offer a solid balance between cost, agility, and sheer bulk. They perform well in any combat environment, but they favor locations with some variation in terrain. In the wide-open desert or depths of outer space, they can fall prey larger mecha.
Combat Statistics: A Huge mecha adds a +16 equipment bonus to a character’s Strength score. It imposes a –2 size penalty on attack rolls and to Defense. Depending on the material used, a Huge mecha has 200 bonus hit points, which are added to the character’s total  and subtracted first when the character takes damage. It takes a –8 penalty on Hide checks.
A Huge mecha has a single slam attack that deals 2d6 points of damage (plus the character’s increased Strength modifier). Its reach is 10 feet.

Torso: 1 slot.
Belt: 1 slot.
Boots: 1 slot.

GARGANTUAN MECHA
Gargantuan mecha are highly experimental in PL 6 societies, but quite common at PL 7. Units of this size are titans of the battlefield, able to destroy almost anything they can hit. Gargantuan mecha are common in outer space environments but are often too expensive and unwieldy for planet-based missions.
Combat Statistics: A Gargantuan mecha adds a +24 equipment bonus to a character’s Strength score and a –2 penalty to Dexterity. It imposes a –4 size penalty on attack rolls and to Defense. Depending on the material used, a Gargantuan mecha has 400 bonus hit points, which are added to the character’s total and subtracted first when the character takes damage. It takes a –12 penalty on Hide checks. A Gargantuan mecha has a single slam attack that deals 2d8 points of damage (plus the character’s increased Strength modifier). Its reach is 15 feet.
Base Purchase DC: 48.

Belt: 1 slot.
Left leg: 1 slot.
Right leg: 1 slot.
Boots: 1 slot.

COLOSSAL MECHA
Colossal mecha do not exist in PL 6 societies and are rare sights even at PL 7. Only at PL 8 do they leave the experimental stage and enter the battlefield in respectable numbers. Massive juggernauts, Colossal mecha represent the epitome of futuristic warfare, with firepower sufficient to destroy starships or level entire city blocks. They typically serve as mobile artillery and walking weapon platforms.
Combat Statistics: A Colossal mecha adds a +32 equipment bonus to a character’s Strength score and a –4 penalty to Dexterity. It imposes a –8 size penalty on attack rolls and to Defense. Depending on the material used, a Colossal mecha has 800 bonus hit points, which are added to the character’s total and subtracted first when the character takes damage. It takes a –16 penalty on Hide checks. A Colossal mecha has a single slam attack that deals 4d6 points of damage (plus the character’s increased Strength modifier). Its reach is 15 feet.

Torso: 4 slots.
Belt: 2 slots.
Left leg: 2 slots.
Right leg: 2 slots.
Boots: 1 slot.

Quadrupedal Mecha
Mecha can be built with four legs instead of two. A quadrupedal mecha sacrifices equipment slots for added speed and stability. Its base land speed increases by 10 feet, and it gains a +4 stability bonus on checks made to resist bull rush and trip attempts.
A Large quadrupedal mecha has 6 equipment slots instead of 7, giving up its boots slot.
A Huge quadrupedal mecha has 8 equipment slots instead of 11, giving up both hand slots (left and right) and its boots slot.
A Gargantuan quadrupedal mecha has 14 equipment slots instead of 17, giving up both hand slots (left and right) and its boots slot.
A Colossal quadrupedal mecha has 22 equipment slots instead of 25, giving up both hand slots (left and right) and its boots slot.

MECHA SUPERSTRUCTURE
A mecha’s superstructure—its exoskeleton, interior braces, and other structural parts—can be made from any sufficiently advanced metal alloy. Whatever its composition, a mecha’s superstructure has a hardness that reduces the damage the mecha takes from weapons and collisions.
To build a mecha superstructure from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) and a Craft (structural) check (DC 30) after investing the requisite amount of assembly time, based on the mecha’s size: Large 150 hours, Huge 300 hours, Gargantuan 600 hours, Colossal 1,200 hours. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on both skill checks. The character must also make a Wealth check against the mecha’s base purchase DC.
Different types of superstructure materials are presented below and summarized in Table: Superstructure Materials.
Hardness: The amount of damage the material absorbs from a weapon hit or collision.
Base Purchase DC Modifier: The modifier applied to the mecha’s base purchase DC.
Restriction: Since mecha require a license to own and operate, the materials used for making them do not require special licenses to purchase.

MECHA ARMOR
Armor can be welded or otherwise fixed securely to a mecha’s superstructure, providing an equipment bonus to the mecha’s Defense. Mecha armor does not impose a maximum Dexterity bonus upon the mecha operator (as worn armor does) and does not require a special proficiency feat to use.
Installing armor on a mecha requires a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 20). The check is made after investing an amount of time determined by the mecha’s size: Large 3 hours, Huge 6 hours, Gargantuan 12 hours, and Colossal 24 hours. Armor can be removed in half the time with a successful Repair check (DC 20).
Different types of mecha armor are presented below, along with the following statistics:
Equipment Bonus: The equipment bonus that the armor provides to the operator’s Defense.
Armor Penalty: Mecha armor applies this penalty on its operator’s Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, and Tumble checks.

MECHA EQUIPMENT
Mecha equipment falls into several categories: flight systems, sensor systems, defense systems, weapons (both hand-held and integrated), and miscellaneous systems.
Installing a piece of equipment on a mecha—be it a weapon or some other integrated system—requires a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 20). The check is made after investing an amount of time determined by the mecha’s size: Large 10 minutes, Huge 30 minutes, Gargantuan 1 hour, Colossal 3 hours. If the weapon or system occupies more than one equipment slot on the mecha, multiply the installation time by the number of slots it takes up. An integrated weapon or system can be removed in half the time with a successful Repair check (DC 20).
In addition to a general description, each piece of equipment includes the following information:
Equipment Slots: The number of equipment slots needed to install the equipment. Some pieces of equipment are limited to specific body slots, as noted here.
Activation: How long it takes to activate the piece of equipment (usually an attack action).
Range/Range Increment: A range listing indicates the maximum distance out to which the equipment functions. If a range increment is listed instead, it represents the distance at which accuracy begins to decline, as per the rules on range increments.
Unless otherwise noted, equipment with a range increment has a maximum of ten increments.
Target or Targets/Effect/Area: This entry starts with one of three headings: Target, Effect, or Area. If the target of the component is You, you do not receive a saving throw (and there is no saving throw entry for the piece of equipment). If a component is a weapon capable of autofire, it will be noted here.
Duration: The amount of time a piece of equipment continues to operate before it needs to be reactivated, or how long its effect lasts. A duration of persistent means the equipment functions until the mecha is destroyed (reduced to 0 hit points) or the mecha’s operator turns it off (usually as a free action). 
Saving Throw: If a piece of equipment calls for a saving throw, the type of saving throw is listed here, along with the effect of a successful save.
Purchase DC: The purchase DC for the Wealth check to acquire the equipment.
Restriction: The level of license required to purchase the equipment legally.

Leave Room for the Pilot
When equipping a mecha from scratch, make sure to leave at least two vacant equipment slots for the mecha operator’s cockpit. (The cost of the cockpit is already factored into the mecha’s base purchase DC.) On Large mecha, the operator always occupies two of the following three equipment slots: helmet, torso, and back. On Huge and bigger mecha, the designer has more choice when placing the operator’s cockpit.
Copilot and passenger cockpits are described under Miscellaneous Equipment.

MECHA FLIGHT SYSTEMS
All mecha are equipped with legs that allow them to walk and run. A mecha’s size determines its base speed, as noted in Table: Mecha Sizes. This section describes various optional flight systems. To build a flight system from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30) after investing 60 hours in its assembly. A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the flight system’s purchase DC.

AFTERBURNER SYSTEM (PL 6)
The afterburner system dumps a shot of raw fuel into the mecha’s thruster system, giving the mecha a temporary speed boost. The mecha’s fly speed is doubled for 1 round. The afterburner system is good for only one use; additional activations require additional afterburner systems.
Equipment Slots: 1, must be torso, back, or leg.
Activation: Free action.

Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 10 + one-quarter the mecha’s purchase DC.
Restriction: None.

MECHA SENSOR SYSTEMS
Sensor systems make it easier for mecha operators to perceive their surroundings; however, not all mecha are equipped with sensors (or even require them). In such cases, mecha operators must rely on their own acute vision and hearing.
A mecha equipped with sensors conducts passive scans of the surrounding area constantly, without the operator’s attention. A passive scan extends in all directions at once, providing the operator with data on surrounding terrain, obstacles, and the location of other creatures, vehicles, and mecha within several miles of the mecha’s position.
A sensor system can also be used to conduct an active scan of a single target. With a successful Computer Use check (DC 15) and a move action, a mecha’s operator can use the onboard sensor system to actively scan a single nonliving target (usually another mecha or vehicle) and determine specific information about that target, as specified in the sensor system’s description.
To build a sensor system from scratch, a character must succeed at a Craft (electrical) check (DC 30) after investing 60 hours in its assembly. A character without an electrical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on the skill check. The character must also make a Wealth check against the sensor system’s purchase DC.

CLASS I SENSOR SYSTEM (PL 6)
This sensor system includes air/space radar that allows a mecha operator to scan the basic topography of the surrounding area and pick out targets well enough to aim weapons at them. A Class I sensor system grants a +2 equipment bonus on the operator’s Navigate and Spot checks.
With a successful Computer Use check (DC 15) and a move action, the operator can use the sensor system to actively scan a single nonliving target (usually another mecha or vehicle) and determine all the following information about that target:
• The target’s size.
• The target’s locomotive capabilities.
• The target’s present direction or trajectory.
Equipment Slots: 1.
Activation: Move action (active scan mode only).
Range: 1-mile-radius emanation centered on your mecha.

Restriction: Licensed (+1).

ENIGMA SENSOR SUITE (PL 6)
Using a combination of thermal imaging, X-rays, and vibration sensors, the Enigma sensor suite enables the operator to effectively see through solid objects. Fine details can’t be detected, but a mecha using the Enigma suite could tell, for example, that three Medium-size humanoids were crouched behind a closed door, or that an escape tunnel runs from one building to another.
A mecha with the Enigma suite reduces the effects of concealment by two grades. Thus, an object with total concealment (50% miss chance) would have three-quarters concealment (30% miss chance) instead.
Equipment Slots: 1.
Activation: None.
Range: 150 feet.
Area: Cone-shaped emanation.
Duration: 1 round.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 29.

MISCELLANEOUS EQUIPMENT
This section describes various other pieces of mecha equipment that don’t fall neatly under the other categories, including a variety of electrical systems.
Building a system from scratch requires a character to make a Wealth check against the system’s purchase DC, invest time in its assembly, and succeed at a Craft (electrical), Craft (mechanical), or Craft (structural) check (DC 30)—whichever seems most appropriate given the type of equipment. See the Craft skill description for further guidance. A character without the appropriate electrical or mechanical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on the skill check.

COCKPIT, COPILOT (PL 5)
This extra cockpit provides a comfortable station inside the mecha for a Small or Medium-size copilot. A copilot has the ability to fire the mecha’s ranged weapons, perform active scans using the mecha’s sensor systems, or aid the pilot’s attacks and skill checks (using the aid another action). Melee combat, defense, and movement remain under the control of the mecha’s operator in the main cockpit. A copilot doesn’t grant the mecha additional attacks in a round, and only one character may fire each ranged weapon each round. The mecha operator or copilot can transfer weapon control as a free action.
As a move action, the mecha’s operator can lock out one or more copilot cockpits, shutting off the cameras, locking the hatches, and so on.
It takes a successful Computer Use check (DC 25 if the operator is disabled, 35 if the operator is still active) to switch overall control of the mecha to a copilot cockpit.

STRUCTURAL ENHANCEMENT (PL 7)
Significant advances in engineering inspire a series of modifications to the mecha’s superstructure, granting it an additional 50 hit points. A mecha can undergo structural enhancement multiple times, gaining 50 additional hit points each time, but it can never have more than twice its starting hit points (as noted in Table: Mecha Sizes).
A character may structurally enhance a mecha with a successful Craft (structural) check (DC 30) after devoting an amount of time that varies depending on the mecha’s size: Large 30 hours, Huge 60 hours, Gargantuan 120 hours, Colossal 240 hours. A character attempting the procedure without a mechanical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on the skill check.
Each time a mecha is structurally enhanced, it loses one equipment slot.

MECHA CARGO CAPACITY
Although they are not built to haul cargo, mecha superstructures have a limited amount of storage space. Table: Mecha Cargo Capacity lists the maximum weight in additional cargo (not including crew, weapons, or other integrated equipment) a mecha can transport in its internal storage compartments, as well as the maximum size of an object that will fit inside one of these internal compartments.

Table: Mecha Cargo CapacityMecha SizeCargo CapacityMaximum Object SizeColossal 1,250 lb.HugeGargantuan 500 lb.LargeHuge 250 lb.Medium-sizeLarge 50 lb.Small
MOVEMENT AND COMBAT
Combat between mecha is conducted much as it is between characters. Characters operating mecha are simply much larger and stronger than they would otherwise be, and they can wield truly frightening weapons. However, they still obey the essential rules of movement and combat. They still threaten squares within their reach, take move actions and attack actions, duck behind cover to gain a bonus to Defense, and so forth. In some respects, however, mecha movement and combat differs from character movement and combat. The following sections describe specific situations that arise when mecha maneuver and clash on the battlefield.

COCKPIT ACCESS
It takes a full-round action to climb into a mecha’s cockpit and a move action to activate its various systems so it can move and fight. It takes a full-round action to get out of a mecha unless an HV-5 Haven escape pod or similarly expeditious device is used (see Miscellaneous Equipment).

DRIVING, PILOTING, AND MOVEMENT
Mecha operators use the Drive skill to operate their mecha on the ground and the Pilot skill to operate their mecha in the air or in space.
In general, mecha operators don’t need to make Drive or Pilot checks to steer their mecha around the battlefield. However, these skills may come into play in combat under the following circumstances:
• When trying to move past a foe without provoking an attack of opportunity, a mecha operator can make a Drive check or Pilot check (as appropriate) instead of a Tumble check.
• A mecha operator can oppose a trip attempt with a Drive check (if on the ground) or a Pilot check (if in the air). 
• A successful Pilot check can pull a mecha out of a stall (see Flying Mecha, below).
• A character in a copilot cockpit can use the aid another action, making Drive or Pilot checks (as appropriate) to aid the Drive and Pilot checks of the mecha’s operator.

FLYING MECHA
The vehicle rules are entirely appropriate for ground cars and other normal modes of transportation; however, even a clumsy mecha is more maneuverable than a normal vehicle. 
On the ground, mecha move as characters. They can turn at any time, move in any direction, and stop on a dime. In the air, though, they are more limited.
Most flying mecha have to s low down to make a turn, and many are limited to fairly wide turns and must maintain a minimum forward speed. Each flying mecha has a maneuverability rating, as shown on Table: Flight Maneuverability. A mecha’s flight systems determine its maneuverability.
Minimum Forward Speed: If a flying mecha fails to maintain its minimum forward speed, it must land at the end of its movement. If it is too high above the ground to land, it falls straight down, descending 150 feet in the first round of falling. If this distance brings it to the ground, it takes falling damage. If the fall doesn’t bring the mecha to the ground, the operator must succeed at a Pilot check (DC 20) to recover. Otherwise, it falls another 300 feet. If it hits the ground, it takes falling damage. Otherwise, it has another chance to recover on its next turn.
Hover: The ability to stay in one place while airborne.
Fly Backward: The ability to fly backward.
Reverse: A mecha with good maneuverability uses up 5 feet of its speed to start flying backward.
Turn: How much the flying mecha can turn after covering the stated distance.
Turn in Place: A mecha with good or average maneuverability can “spend” some of its speed to turn in place.
Maximum Turn: How much the mecha can turn in any one space.
Up Angle: The angle at which the mecha can ascend.
Up Speed: How fast the mecha can ascend.
Down Angle: The angle at which the mecha can descend.
Down Speed: A flying mecha can descend at twice its normal flying speed.
Between Down and Up: An average, poor, or clumsy mecha must fly level for a minimum distance after descending and before ascending. Any flying mecha can begin descending after an ascent without an intervening distance.

MECHA IN OUTER SPACE
Only a mecha equipped with space skin (see Miscellaneous Equipment) can operate in outer space. However, the mecha’s operator takes a –4 penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks unless she has the Zero-G Training feat or has equipped her mecha with a zero-g stabilizer.
In outer space, mecha fly just like they do in the atmosphere, with three exceptions. First, all flying mecha improve by one maneuverability category (clumsy becomes poor, poor becomes average, average becomes good, and so on). Second, all mecha can ascend and descend regardless of the limitations on Table: Flight Maneuverability, and their speed is unchanged if they do so. Finally, all mecha can hover in space and need not maintain a minimum forward speed.

MECHA CRITICAL HITS
Whenever you confirm a critical hit against a mecha, you may choose to roll percentile dice and consult Table: Mecha Critical Hits instead of dealing the normal critical hit damage for the attack. However, you must accept the results of the roll, even if those results are less than desirable.
Table: Mecha Critical Hitsd%Roll Effect(s)01–15Normal damage, crew dazed16–35Normal critical hit, crew dazed36–45Normal critical hit, mecha knocked prone46–50Severe critical hit, crew dazed, mecha stunned51–55Severe critical hit, mecha knocked prone56–60Crew hit (normal damage)61–70Normal damage, equipment damaged71–80Normal damage, equipment destroyed81–90Normal critical hit, slot damaged91–100Normal critical hit, slot destroyedNormal Damage: The attack deals normal damage (do not apply critical hit multipliers).
Crew Dazed: Each crewmember aboard the mecha, including its operator, must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15) or be dazed for 1 round. Unable to act, a dazed character can take no actions, but still retains his or her full Defense.
Normal Critical Hit: Roll critical hit damage normally.
Mecha Knocked Prone: The force of the attack knocks the mecha prone. All crewmembers and passengers aboard take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage as they are knocked about their cockpits. A prone mecha takes a –4 penalty on melee attack rolls and can’t use thrown ranged weapons. The mecha gains a +4 bonus to Defense against ranged attacks, but takes a –4 penalty to Defense against melee attacks.
Standing up from prone is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
Mecha Stunned: The mecha automatically drops what it is holding and can take no attack or move actions for 1 round. While the mecha is stunned, apply a –2 penalty to the mecha operator’s Defense (even though the operator is not stunned).
Severe Critical Hit: Roll critical hit damage using a x5 multiplier instead of the weapon’s normal multiplier.
Crew Hit: The attack bypasses the mecha’s armor and superstructure. Apply normal damage to one crewmember or passenger (determined randomly), ignoring the mecha’s bonus hit points.
Equipment Destroyed: One piece of equipment (attacker’s choice) is damaged and ceases to function until repaired. It can be a flight system, sensor system, defense system, weapon (handheld or integrated), or miscellaneous system. Repairing a damaged system requires 1 hour of work and a successful Repair check (DC 20).
Equipment Destroyed: One piece of equipment (attacker’s choice) is destroyed and ceases to function. It can be a flight system, sensor system, defense system, weapon (handheld or integrated), or miscellaneous system. A destroyed system cannot be repaired, only replaced.
Slot Damaged: One of the mecha’s equipment slots (attacker’s choice) is damaged. Any piece of equipment wholly or partially installed in that slot will not function until the slot is repaired. Repairing a damaged equipment slot requires 1 hour of work and a successful Repair check (DC 25).
Slot Destroyed: One of the mecha’s equipment slots (attacker’s choice) is destroyed, along with any piece of equipment wholly or partially installed in it. Rebuilding a destroyed equipment slot requires 12 hours of work and a successful Craft (mechanical) check (DC 30).

RANGED ATTACKS AND ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY
Mecha only provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures of their own size or larger (including other mecha) when they fire a ranged weapon in a threatened area.

STOWING HAND SLOT EQUIPMENT
Any piece of mecha equipment integrated into a mecha’s hand slot—and only the hand slot—can be stowed magnetically against the mecha or in a storage compartment as a move action. This frees up the hand to perform more delicate manipulation (such as opening a door or pressing a button) or grabbing another piece of mecha equipment.
A mecha may have more pieces of equipment for its hand slots than it has hand slots available; it just can’t use them all at once.

MECHA-RELATED FEATS
Mecha operators c an s elect feats that r elate specifically to operating mecha. These feats are all considered bonus feats for the Mecha Jockey advanced class. Whenever the Mecha Jockey is allowed to select a bonus feat, she can choose one of these.

Essential Mecha Feats
A character without the Mecha Operation feat and Mecha Weapon Proficiency feat suffers serious penalties while operating a mecha of any size. The penalties for not having these feats are summarized below:
Mecha Operation: A character without this feat takes a –4 penalty on Balance, Climb, Drive, Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Pilot, and Tumble checks when operating a mecha. Furthermore, the character cannot run or charge.
Mecha Weapon Proficiency: A character without this feat takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls made while operating a mecha. Furthermore, the character cannot apply the various firearm feats (such as Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Dead Aim, Double Tap, Shot on the Run, and Strafe) to a mecha’s ranged weapons.

Mecha and Feats
If you have the Mecha Weapon Proficiency feat, any feats that apply to firearms (such as Double Tap and Strafe) also apply to relevant ranged mecha weapons.
Melee-oriented feats from the Brawl and Combat Martial Arts trees don’t apply if you’re operating a mecha, although a character with the Mecha Operation feat threatens all areas within reach of the mecha, and making a slam or other melee attack with a mecha doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. 
Feats from the Defense Martial Arts tree f unction normally for characters in mecha.

ADVANCED MECHA OPERATION
You have received advanced training or extensive practice in mecha movement.
Prerequisite: Mecha Operation.
Benefit: Choose a size of mecha (Large, Huge, Gargantuan, or Colossal). When you are operating a mecha of the chosen size, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to Defense. Furthermore, armor penalties for operating the mecha are 2 less than they would otherwise be (minimum penalty –0).

HAIR TRIGGER
You have developed a delicate sense of timing, and your area attacks hit your foes when they’re ill-prepared to defend against them.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +6.
Benefit: Whenever you make an attack from your mecha that requires enemies to make Reflex saving throws, the DC for such saves is increased by +2.

MECHA CRUSH
You can hurl your mecha’s body onto opponents to deal tremendous damage.
Prerequisite: Mecha Operation.
Benefit: As an attack action, you can maneuver your mecha to jump or fall onto opponents, using the mecha’s body to crush them. This attack is useful only against creatures at least two size categories smaller than your mecha. The base damage for a crush attack depends on your mecha’s size category, as given below. Add 1.5 times your mecha-modified Strength bonus to this base damage to determine the total damage for the attack.
Mecha SizeDamageLarge 2d6Huge 2d8Gargantuan 4d6Colossal 4d8A crush attack deals bludgeoning damage and affects as many creatures as can fit under your mecha’s body. Each creature in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 10 + your mecha’s size modifier for grapple attacks). On a failure, the creature is pinned and automatically takes crush damage each round the pin is maintained.

MECHA FLING
You can pick up an opponent with your mecha and fling it.
Prerequisite: Mecha Operation, at least one free hand slot.
Benefit: Your mecha can make a grapple check at a –20 penalty against an opponent at least two size categories smaller than it. If the grapple succeeds, you can use an attack action to fling the held opponent on your next action. The range increment for the thrown foe is 10 feet, and the maximum range is 100 feet.
A creature may be thrown horizontally or vertically. If thrown vertically, it takes normal falling damage. If thrown horizontally, it takes damage as though it had fallen half the distance thrown (rounded down), and you may apply your mecha-modified Strength bonus to the damage.
Your mecha may also fling your opponent at another mecha, vehicle, or creature. To do so, make an attack roll at a –4 penalty, with appropriate range penalties, against the target. If you hit, both the thrown creature and the target take the amount of damage that the thrown creature would have otherwise taken, as given above.

MECHA OPERATION
You know how to operate a mecha.
Benefit: You do not suffer the restrictions on movement and penalties on skill checks for being unfamiliar with mecha controls. You can move normally in a mecha and generally perform any action as if you weren’t inside a mecha, subject to the obvious limitations of size. You threaten areas within your reach even if unarmed. 
Normal: Characters without this feat take a –4 penalty on Balance, Climb, Drive, Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Pilot, and Tumble checks when operating a mecha. Furthermore, they cannot run or charge.

MECHA SWEEP
You can use your mecha to wield improvised weapons and attack several spaces at once.
Prerequisite: Mecha Operation, Power Attack, two free hand slots.
Benefit: You can use your mecha’s great size and strength, along with your own knowledge of balance and leverage, to pick up a heavy object (such as a large tree or boulder) and attack an area as an attack action. The area affected is a half-circle with a radius equal to your mecha’s reach. This attack deals damage to all creatures two or more size categories smaller than your mecha within the area. The base damage dealt depends on your mecha’s size, as given below. Add 1.5 times your mecha’s Strength bonus to this base damage to determine the total damage for the attack.
Mecha Size DamageLarge 1d6Huge 1d8Gargantuan 2d6Colossal 2d8Though it can deal significant damage, this form of attack is awkward and unbalancing. You take a –2 penalty to your mecha’s Defense and on Reflex saves until your next turn.

MECHA TRAMPLE
Your mecha can knock down and crush opponents.
Prerequisite: Mecha Operation, base attack bonus +4.
Benefit: When you attempt to overrun an opponent while operating a mecha, the target may not choose to avoid your mecha. If your mecha knocks down the target, your mecha may make one free slam attack against the target, gaining a +4 bonus on the attack roll because the target is prone.

MECHA WEAPON BOOST
By disabling safeguards and shunting auxiliary power into your weapons, you can attain greater destructive power at the cost of weapon accuracy.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +8, Repair 6 ranks.
Benefit: You can take a penalty of up to –5 on your attack roll. If you do, the mecha weapon of your choice deals +1d6 points of damage for each –1 penalty you took. The attack penalty persists until the beginning of your next turn, but the additional damage applies only to the next single attack you make.

MECHA WEAPON PROFICIENCY
You know how to acquire targets and fire your mecha’s weapons using onboard computers and sensors.
Prerequisite: Mecha Operation.
Benefit: You no longer suffer the standard penalties on attack rolls while you’re in your mecha. You can use any feats that refer to firearms with your ranged mecha weapons.
Normal: Characters without this feat take a –4 penalty on attack rolls made while in a mecha cockpit. Furthermore, they cannot apply firearm feats to a mecha’s ranged weapons.

STUN MECHA
By channeling electricity into an enemy mecha’s control system, you can temporarily short it out.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +8, Mecha Operation, Precise Shot.
Benefit: If you threaten a critical hit with an electricity attack against another mecha, you may automatically confirm the critical. In addition to suffering the effects of the critical hit, the mecha is automatically stunned for 2d4 rounds. The stunned mecha automatically drops what it is holding and can take no attack or move actions. While the mecha is stunned, apply a –2 penalty to the mecha operator’s Defense (even though the operator is not stunned).

THRUSTER BLAST
By directing your vectored thrusters all around your mecha, you can kick up a cloud of dust and debris that obscures the battlefield.
Prerequisite: Pilot 10 ranks, mecha flight system (either jetpack, thruster boots, or ramjet thruster boots).
Benefit: You can aim your thruster exhaust toward the ground to create a hemispherical cloud. If you are within 30 feet of the ground and there is loose debris or dust, you can create a cloud with a 50-foot radius centered directly below you. The generated winds snuff out small fires and give guided missiles attacking you a –4 penalty on their attack rolls. Creatures without eye protection caught within the debris cloud are blinded while inside it and for 1 round after emerging from it. The debris cloud grants anyone inside it one-half concealment (20% miss chance). Mecha with sensor systems ignore the concealment effects.
Because some mecha have vectored thrust systems, their flight path isn’t affected by the aim of the exhaust. They don’t have to hover or fly upward to create the cloud.

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Mecha Jockey advanced class.
Mecha Weapon Proficiency
At 1st level, the Mecha Jockey gains the bonus feat Mecha Weapon Proficiency.
Luv My Mecha
Starting at 2nd level, a Mecha Jockey gains a bonus on Drive, Pilot, and Repair checks when applied to a mecha he designates as familiar. The same bonus is applied to the Mecha Jockey’s attack rolls with the mecha’s ranged weapons. This bonus is +1 at 2nd level and increases by 1 every three levels thereafter (+2 at 5th level, +3 at 8th level).
To designate a mecha as familiar, the Mecha Jockey must have operated it for at least one month. Minor changes and upgrades to the mecha don’t affect familiarity, but if the Mecha Jockey switches to a mecha with a different size, different superstructure, different flight system, or more than one new weapon, he must operate it for at least one month before he is familiar with it. A Mecha Jockey can be familiar with only one mecha at a time.
Bonus Feat

Mecha Feint
At 4th level, a Mecha Jockey operating a mecha can make a Bluff check in combat as a move action (instead of an attack action). He receives a +2 bonus on the Bluff check made to feint in melee combat.
If the Mecha Jockey has the Improved Feint feat, his bonus on Bluff checks made to feint increases to +4 while operating a mecha.
Evasive Action
At 7th level, the Mecha Jockey can make a Drive, Pilot, or Tumble check (as appropriate) to lessen the damage dealt by a successful attack against his mecha. If the check result exceeds the attack roll, the damage is reduced by half (round fractions down, minimum of 1 point of damage). The Mecha Jockey can make an evasive action check once per round.
Improved Evasive Action
At 10th level, the Mecha Jockey’s evasive action ability improves. A successful Drive, Pilot, or Tumble check negates all damage dealt by the attack.
