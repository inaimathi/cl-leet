Flesh Golem
Species Traits
Construct: Flesh golems have the traits and immunities common to constructs.
Speed: Flesh golems can’t take run actions.
Berserk (Ex): When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round it will go berserk. An uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, which requires a successful Charisma check (DC 19). Following such a successful check, it takes 1 minute of rest by the golem to reset the golem’s berserk chance to 0%.
Magic Immunity (Ex): A flesh golem is immune to all spells, psionic powers, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as follows. Attacks that deal fire or cold damage slow it for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw (see the slow spell). A slowed golem can take only one move or attack action each turn. Additionally, the slowed golem takes a –2 penalty to Defense, melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and Reflex saves. Any amount of electricity damage dealt to the golem breaks the slow effect and cures 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. The golem rolls no saving throw against effects that deal electricity damage.
Damage Reduction 15/+1 (Su): In campaigns without magic weapons, the GM can either disregard the golem’s damage reduction or apply the damage reduction only to certain types of weapons (ballistic, bludgeoning, sonic/concussion, piercing, or slashing).

Species Traits
Plant: Monstrous flytraps have the traits and immunities common to plants.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A monstrous flytrap can swallow a grabbed opponent two size categories smaller than it by making a successful grapple check. The swallowed creature can attack the flytrap from inside its mouth using claws or a Small or Tiny slashing weapon.

Monstrous Spider
Monstrous spiders come in two general types: hunters and web spinners. 
Species Traits
Monstrous spiders have the following traits.
Speed: Hunting spiders are speedier than their web-spinning counterparts. Increase the normal speed of hunting spiders by 10 feet. Climb speed remains unchanged.
Poison (Ex): A monstrous spider injects poison into its victim with a successful bite. The victim must succeed on a Fortitude save or take the initial damage; a second Fortitude save must be made 1 minute later to negate the poison’s secondary damage. The DC of the Fortitude saves and the effects vary depending on the monstrous spider’s size, as shown on Table: Monstrous Spider Poison.

Web (Ex): Monstrous spiders often wait in their webs or in trees, then lower themselves silently on silk strands and leap onto prey passing beneath. A single strand is strong enough to support the spider and one creature of the same size.
Web-spinning spiders can cast a web eight times per day. Casting a web is a melee touch attack with a maximum range of 50 feet and a range increment of 10 feet, and the web is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the spider. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst it with a Strength check. Both are attack actions whose DCs are given in Table: Monstrous Spider Webs.
Web-spinning spiders often create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet square, depending on the size of the spider. They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a Spot check (DC 20) to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section has the hit points listed on below and damage reduction 5/fire.
A monstrous spider can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can determine the exact location of any creature touching the web.

Resistance to Massive Damage: Monstrous spiders gain a +5 species bonus on Fortitude saves to negate the effects of massive damage.
Skill Bonuses: Monstrous spiders receive a +4 species bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks and a +8 species bonus on Spot checks. Hunting spiders receive a +6 species bonus on Jump checks.

Mummy
Species Traits
Undead: Mummies have the traits and immunities common to undead.
Despair (Su): At the mere sight of a mummy, the viewer must succeed on a Will save (DC 15) or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that mummy’s despair ability for one day.
Mummy Rot (Su): A mummy’s touch carries a horrible rotting disease (Fort save DC 20 negates; incubation period 1 day; damage 1d6 temporary Constitution). The GM may allow characters to create medicine to treat the disease using the Craft (pharmaceutical) skill. In a campaign that uses magic, a remove disease spell can cure this disease. The only other way to halt the disease’s advance is to amputate whatever appendage the mummy touched (usually a hand, arm, leg, or foot). Amputating a limb deals 1d4+1 points of temporary Constitution damage, although a successful Treat Injury check (DC 25) reduces the temporary Constitution damage to 1 point.
An afflicted creature that dies of mummy rot shrivels away and turns to dust.
Fire Vulnerability (Ex): A mummy takes double damage from fire attacks unless a save is allowed for half damage. A successful save halves the damage, and a failure doubles it.
Resistant to Blows (Ex): Physical attacks deal only half damage to mummies. Apply this effect before damage reduction.
Damage Reduction 5/+1 (Su): In campaigns without magic weapons, the GM can either disregard the mummy’s damage reduction or apply the damage reduction only to certain types of weapons (ballistic, bludgeoning, sonic/concussion, piercing, or slashing). 
Bonus Feat: Mummies receive the bonus feat Archaic Weapons Proficiency.
Automatic Language: Mummies read, write, and speak one language.

Puppeteer
Species Traits
Combined Challenge Rating: The Challenge Rating of a puppeteer with a host is equal to the host’s Challenge Rating +1.
Glide (Sp): A puppeteer can glide through the air at a speed of 20 feet for up to 16 minutes at a time, with poor maneuverability. The puppeteer cannot manifest psionic powers while gliding.
Psionics (Sp): 3/day—brain lock, lesser domination. These abilities are as the psionic powers of an 8th-level manifester.
Thrall (Sp): If a puppeteer successfully uses lesser domination on its host seven times, the final effect is permanent, bonding the host to the puppeteer. The thralled host will carry out the orders of the puppeteer, including self-destructive orders. Actions against the host’s original nature allow the host a Will save (DC 22) to resist, with a –10 penalty on the roll. A successful save negates that particular action (or future occurrences of that action), but the host remains the puppeteer’s thrall.
Shared Host (Ex): When multiple puppeteers prey on a single host, the blood drain can be too great for the host to bear. The extensive blood drain deals 1 point of temporary Constitution damage per day, and a host reduced to 0 Constitution in this fashion dies. The minimum number of puppeteers needed to cause temporary Constitution damage depends on the host’s size: Diminutive 2, Tiny 4, Small 12, Medium-size 20, Large 30, Gargantuan 50, Colossal 90.
Blindsight (Ex): A puppeteer can ascertain creatures by nonvisual means within 60 feet. The puppeteer confers blindsight upon its host.
Host Protection (Ex): An attached puppeteer uses its host’s base saving throw bonuses if they’re better than its own. Effects that target vermin can’t affect a puppeteer riding a humanoid host.
Immunities: Puppeteers are immune to mind-influencing effects. This ability is conferred upon the puppeteer’s host as well.
Resistance to Massive Damage (Ex): Puppeteers gain a +5 species bonus on Fortitude saves to negate the effects of massive damage. This ability is conferred upon the puppeteer’s host as well.
Shared Skills: The puppeteer retains its skills when it takes a host. The host gains a +4 bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Replacement (Template)
A replacement is a physical duplicate of a specific humanoid, called a primary. Although a replacement does not gain the specific life experiences of its primary, it can easily mimic the demeanor and general behavior of the primary, enabling it to fill the same general role as the primary. A replacement is identical in appearance to the primary except it has jet-black eyes with no visible irises. Some replacements wear special contact lenses (purchase DC 12) to conceal this sinister physical divergence.
Replacements are bred in laboratories. A sample of the primary’s subdermal tissue is required to create a replacement (dead skin cells or hair follicles will not do), and an adult replacement takes two months to grow. Creating a replacement requires a successful Craft (pharmaceutical) check (DC 50). The check must be made 1 month into the replacement’s growth period, and a failed roll indicates the premature death of the replacement. Financing the growth and development of a replacement also requires a successful Wealth check against a purchase DC of 48, rolled before the process of growing the clone commences.
Template Traits
“Replacement” is an inherited template that can be added to any humanoid (referred to hereafter as the original). A replacement uses all the primary’s statistics except as noted here.
Challenge Rating: Same as the original –1.
Hit Dice: Change to one die type smaller than the primary.
Special Qualities: A replacement gains all of the original’s extraordinary abilities but none of its supernatural or spell-like abilities (including psionics). A replacement gains none of the original’s other special qualities or talents. A replacement knows that it lacks some of the abilities of the original and occasionally feels resentful toward the original for this reason.
In addition to its inherited extraordinary abilities, a replacement has the following special quality:
Limited Existence (Ex): A replacement has a programmed natural life span of one to four years (the creator must specify the life span when the project to create the replacement begins). Once the replacement reaches the end of its programmed life span, it must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) once per day. Each failed save drains the replacement of 1d6 points of Constitution. This ability drain cannot be restored by any means. When its Constitution drops to 0, the replacement dissolves into a mass of protoplasmic goo. A replacement that dies before this time retains the shape of the original.
Allegiances: A replacement’s primary allegiance is to its creator or owner. This allegiance cannot be broken unless the creator or owner does something to break it (such as by attacking the replacement). 
Saves: As the original, modified by altered ability scores (see Abilities, below).
Action Points: Replacements do not acquire or amass action points.
Abilities: As the original, except ability scores cannot exceed 12. Ability scores of 13 or higher for the original are reduced to 12 for the replacement. A replacement that gains levels can never raise an ability score above 12.
Skills: A replacement has access to any skill in which the original has ranks, and all of a replacement’s skills are class skills even if they are cross-class skills for the original. A replacement gets a number of skill points per Hit Die equal to 4 + the replacement’s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 skill point per Hit Die). The replacement can never have more ranks in a skill than the original.
The replacement gains a +4 species bonus on Disguise checks when impersonating the original. The bonus increases to +10 if the replacement wears contact lenses that hide its distinctive black eyes.
Feats: A replacement gains the original’s feats but cannot use any feat for which it no longer meets the prerequisites.
Automatic Languages: A replacement can read, write, and speak any language known by the original.
Advancement: By character class.

Robot
Species Traits
Construct: Robots have the traits and immunities common to constructs.
Speed: A robot’s speed depends on its size and method of locomotion (bipedal, quadrupedal, tracked, or wheeled). The different speeds are given with each robot’s statistics (below).
Attacks: A robot is not normally equipped with weapons. Robots fitted with arms or similar manipulators can attempt to grapple things, but the manipulators are too small to deal damage.
Skills: A character with four or more levels in the Techie advanced class can program one or more ranks of a single skill into a Diminutive or Tiny robot. Otherwise, a robot has no skills.

Skeleton (Template)
Template Traits
“Skeleton” is an acquired template that can be added to any living corporeal creature that has a skeletal structure (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A skeleton uses all the base creature’s statistics except as noted here.
Challenge Rating: A skeleton’s Challenge Rating depends on its size: Tiny or smaller 1/10, Small 1/6, Medium-size 1/3, Large 2, Huge 5, Gargantuan 9, Colossal 12.
Type: The creature’s type changes to undead.
Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice gained from attaining levels, and raise the remaining Hit Dice to d12.
Speed: Winged skeletons can’t use their wings to fly. If the base creature flew magically, so can the skeleton.
Defense: A skeleton’s natural armor bonus to Defense changes to a value based on its size: Tiny or smaller +0, Small +1, Medium-size +2, Large +3, Huge +4, Gargantuan +6, Colossal +10.
Attacks: A skeleton retains all the natural attacks, manufactured weapons, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for attacks that can’t work without flesh. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the skeleton can strike with all of them at its full attack bonus. (If the base creature already had claw attacks, it can use the skeleton claw attack and damage, if they’re better.)
Damage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A claw attack deals damage depending on the skeleton’s size (use the base creature’s claw damage if it’s greater): Diminutive or Fine 1, Tiny 1d2, Small 1d3, Medium-size 1d4, Large 1d6, Huge 1d8, Gargantuan 2d6, Colossal 2d8.
Special Qualities: A skeleton loses all of the base creature’s special qualities except for immunity or resistance to specific energy types. In addition to gaining the undead type, a skeleton has the following special quality.
Skeleton Immunities (Ex): A skeleton has cold immunity. Because it lacks flesh and internal organs, a skeleton takes only half damage from ballistic, piercing, or slashing weapons.
Allegiances: A skeleton loses any previous allegiances and adopts a new allegiance to its creator. This allegiance cannot be broken.
Saves: A skeleton’s saving throw modifiers are based on Hit Dice and given in Table: Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses.
Action Points: A skeleton does not acquire or amass action points. It loses any action points possessed by the base creature.
Reputation Bonus: A skeleton has a +0 Reputation bonus.
Ability Scores: A skeleton gains the following ability score increase: Dexterity +2. In addition, a skeleton has no Constitution or Intelligence score, its Wisdom changes to 10, and its Charisma changes to 1.
Skills: A skeleton loses all skills.
Feats: A skeleton loses all feats except those that confer armor or weapon proficiency (Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Armor Proficiency, Exotic Firearms Proficiency, Exotic Melee Weapon Proficiency, Personal Firearms Proficiency, and Simple Weapons Proficiency). A skeleton gains the feat Improved Initiative.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check against a creature of its size or smaller, a constrictor snake deals damage equal to its bite damage.
Poison (Ex): A viper injects venom with a successful bite. The victim must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage; a second Fortitude save must be made 1 minute later to negate the venom’s secondary damage (same as the initial damage). The save DC is equal to 11 + 1/2 the snake’s Hit Dice + the snake’s Constitution modifier (DC 11 for a Tiny viper).
Scent (Ex): This ability allows a snake to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. See Special Qualities for more information.

Species Traits
Pounce (Ex): If a tiger leaps upon a foe during the first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it has already taken a move action.

Tooth Fairy
Species Traits
Fey Rod (Sp): A tooth fairy’s preferred weapon is a 1-foot-long rod of ash wood. A fey rod allows its wielder to cast the following spells as a 3rd-level Mage (save DC 10 + spell level): daze (DC 10), knock, light, magic missile, and sleep (DC 11). Using any of the rod’s powers is an attack action. The fey rod can cast seven spells per day and has a hardness of 5, 1 hit point, and a break DC of 11. A tooth fairy that loses its fey rod fights to the death to retrieve it or takes 1d4 points of temporary Wisdom damage every 24 hours the fairy and the rod remain separated. Destroying the rod instantly slays the tooth fairy, turning both to dust.
Invisibility (Sp): A tooth fairy can turn itself invisible at will, as a move action. This ability works only after sunset and before sunrise, but the duration of the invisibility is otherwise unlimited. An invisible tooth fairy becomes visible when it attacks.
Anyspeak (Sp): A tooth fairy can speak, read, and write any spoken language.

Troglodyte
Species Traits
Stench (Ex): When a troglodyte is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musklike chemical that most animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except troglodytes) within 30 feet of the troglodyte must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 13) or take a –2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 10 rounds.

Regeneration (Ex): A troll regenerates 5 points of damage each round but cannot regenerate acid or fire damage. If a troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.

Vampire (Template)
Vampires speak, read, and write the languages they knew in life.
Template Traits
“Vampire” is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid, or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creature’s type changes to undead. It uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.
Undead: Vampires have the traits and immunities common to undead.
Hit Dice: Change to d12. Vampires have no Constitution score.
Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the vampire retains the ability to swim and is not vulnerable to immersion in running water (see below).
Defense: The base creature’s natural armor improves by +6.
Attacks: A vampire retains all the attacks of the base creature and gains a slam attack if it didn’t already have one. The vampire’s slam attack deals damage according to its size: Fine 1, Diminutive 1d2, Tiny 1d3, Small 1d4, Medium-size 1d6, Large 1d8, Huge 2d6, Gargantuan 2d8, Colossal 4d6.
Special Qualities: A vampire retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains the additional special qualities described below.
Blood Drain (Ex): A vampire can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of temporary Constitution damage each round the pin is maintained.
Create Spawn (Su): A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by a vampire’s energy drain attack rises as a vampire loyal to its creator (called the master vampire, or simply “master”). The new vampire gains three allegiances (in any order): chaos, evil, and master. All previous allegiances are lost permanently. A vampire loses its allegiance to its master (and may adopt a new allegiance to replace it) only when the master vampire is destroyed.
Domination (Su): As an attack action, a vampire can crush an opponent’s will just by gazing into his or her eyes. The vampire can attempt to dominate only one target at a time, and the target must be within 30 feet and able to see the vampire. A target that fails a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 vampire’s Hit Dice + vampire’s Charisma modifier) becomes the vampire’s thrall for 1 day per Hit Die of the vampire. The thrall temporarily loses all previous allegiances and adopts a singular, unswerving allegiance to the vampire. If the vampire commands its thrall to do something blatantly self-destructive, the target can make a Will save to break the vampire’s control. If the save succeeds, the target becomes free-willed and regains its previous allegiances.
Energy Drain (Su): A living creature hit by a vampire’s slam attack gains two negative levels. See page 226 for more information on energy drain and negative levels. A creature killed by a vampire’s energy drain attack rises as a vampire under its creator’s control (see Create Spawn, above).
Alternate Form (Su): A vampire can assume the form of a bat, rat, or wolf as a move action. The vampire can remain in that form until it assumes another form or until the next sunrise.
Children of the Night (Su): Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and, once per day, can call forth a pack of 4d8 rats, a swarm of 10d10 bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a full-round action. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.
Damage Reduction 15/+1 (Su): In campaigns without magic weapons, the GM can disregard the vampire’s damage reduction, change it to 15/silver or 15/wood, or apply the damage reduction only to certain types of weapons (ballistic, bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or sonic/concussion).
Fast Healing 5 (Ex): A vampire heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points or lower, a vampire automatically assumes gaseous form (see below) and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Once at rest in its coffin, its hit points rise to 1 hit point after 1 hour; the vampire then resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.
Gaseous Form (Su): As a move action, the vampire (and all its gear) becomes insubstantial, misty, and translucent. The vampire gains damage reduction 20/+1 in this form. Its armor (including natural armor) ceases to modify its Defense, though other modifiers (such as from Dexterity and size) still apply. The vampire cannot attack or use supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. 
A vampire in this form can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks. Its gaseous form is subject to wind and cannot enter water or other liquid.
Cold Resistance 20 (Ex): A vampire ignores the first 20 points of cold damage from any cold-based attack.
Electricity Resistance 20 (Ex): A vampire ignores the first 20 points of electricity damage from any electricity-based attack.
Spider Climb (Ex): A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though with a spider climb spell.
Turn Resistance (Ex): A vampire has +4 turn resistance.
Darkvision (Ex): Vampires have darkvision with a range of 60 feet. 
Weaknesses (Ex): A vampire has several weaknesses, described below. A vampire can have fewer weaknesses, but each lost weakness costs a vampire one of its other special qualities. For example, a vampire that is immune to the effects of garlic might be unable to summon children of the night.
Direct Sunlight: The merest sliver of sunlight deals 2d6 points of damage to a vampire. A vampire exposed to direct sunlight for 1 full round must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 20) or be consumed by fire and destroyed utterly.
Garlic: A vampire cannot enter or pass through any 5-foot square containing garlic. A vampire takes a –2 penalty on melee attack rolls against a target wearing garlic.
Holy Symbol: A vampire takes a –2 penalty on melee attack rolls against a creature prominently wearing or brandishing a holy symbol. The symbol’s touch deals 1d4 points of holy damage to a vampire, and a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this fashion is destroyed utterly. This holy damage can be healed only by inflict spells.
Inviolate Sanctuary: A vampire cannot enter a privately owned residence unless invited in by the rightful owner or tenant.
Mirror: A vampire in view of a mirror cannot use its domination special quality (see above).
Running Water: A vampire cannot cross running water (but may be carried across). A vampire immersed in running water loses one-third of its remaining hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third round.
Wooden Stake: Wooden weapons that deal piercing damage (such as wooden stakes, arrows, pool cues, spear shafts, and table legs) threaten a critical hit against a vampire on a natural 20 (unless noted otherwise), even though vampires are normally immune to critical hits. A successful critical hit destroys a vampire instantly, turning it to dust.
Allegiances: Previous allegiances are lost, replaced by allegiances to chaos, evil, and master (or simply chaos and evil if the master vampire has been destroyed). Changed allegiances might cause the loss of particular class abilities.
Ability Scores: Vampires gain the following ability score increases: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As undead creatures, vampires have no Constitution score.
Skills: Same as the base creature (human vampires retain the extra skill points afforded to all humans). Vampires receive a +8 species bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks.
Feats: Vampires gain the bonus feats Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative, and Lightning Reflexes, assuming the base creature meets the prerequisites and doesn’t already have these feats. Human vampires keep the extra feat they gained as a 1st-level human character.
Advancement: By character class.

“Werewolf” is a template (inherited for natural werewolves, acquired for afflicted werewolves) that can be added to any humanoid creature (referred to hereafter as the character).
A werewolf uses either the character’s or the wolf’s statistics and special abilities in addition to those described below.
Challenge Rating: Same as the character +2. 
Hit Dice: Same as the character plus the wolf’s Hit Dice (2d8).
Speed: Same as the character, or 50 feet for hybrid and wolf form.
Defense: Same as the character while in humanoid form. In hybrid and animal form, the creature gains a +2 natural armor bonus. This bonus does not stack with other natural armor bonuses.
Base Attack: Same as the character +1.
Grapple Bonus: Apply modifiers for Strength depending on the lycanthrope’s form.
Attacks: Same as the character while in humanoid form. In hybrid and animal form, a werewolf attacks with its powerful bite, dealing 1d6 points of damage plus its Strength modifier.
Special Qualities: A werewolf retains all the special qualities of the character and gains the additional special qualities listed below.
Alternate Form (Su): A werewolf can assume wolf or hybrid form, but its gear is not absorbed into the new form. The bipedal hybrid form is about 6 feet tall, with a short tail and thick fur. The legs are like those of a wolf, and the head combines humanoid and lupine features in degrees that vary from one werewolf to the next. The animal form is that of a fully-grown wolf without any trace of human features.
Changing to or from wolf or hybrid form is a move action. Upon assuming either form, the werewolf regains hit points as if having rested for a day. A slain werewolf reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead. Afflicted werewolves find this ability difficult to control (see Lycanthropy as an Affliction, below), but natural lycanthropes have full control over this power.
Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): Any humanoid hit by a werewolf’s bite attack (in wolf or hybrid form) must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15) or contract lycanthropy.
Trip (Ex): A werewolf in wolf form that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip its opponent as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the werewolf.
Scent (Ex): This ability allows a werewolf in wolf or hybrid form to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
Damage Reduction 15/Silver (Su): A werewolf in wolf or hybrid form ignores the first 15 points of damage dealt by a nonsilver or nonmagical weapon but takes full damage from silvered weapons or weapons with a +1 or better magic bonus.
Wolf Empathy (Ex): A werewolf can communicate with wolves in any form and gains a +4 species bonus on Diplomacy checks when influencing a wolf’s attitude. A friendly wolf understands and heeds simple commands, such as “wait,” “chase,” “flee,” and “attack.”
Darkvision (Ex): In their wolf and hybrid forms, werewolves have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
Saves: Same as the character, with a +3 bonus on Fortitude and Reflex saves.
Ability Scores: Werewolves gain the following ability score increases: Con +4, Wis +2. Additionally, a werewolf that assumes wolf and hybrid form gains the following additional benefits for as long as it remains in either form: Str +2, Dex +4.
Allegiances: A natural werewolf typically has allegiance to chaos and evil. An afflicted werewolf gains the chaos and evil allegiances (displacing other allegiances, if need be). These allegiances can be removed only when the werewolf has the ability to control the curse of lycanthropy by taking 10 on a Control Shape check. 
Skills: Same as the character, with a +1 species bonus on Hide checks, a +2 species bonus on Move Silently checks, a +3 species bonus on Spot checks, and a +5 species bonus on Listen checks. A werewolf in wolf or hybrid form also gains a +4 species bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.
Feats: Same as the character. A werewolf gains the bonus feats Iron Will and Weapon Finesse (bite).
Talents: Same as the character.

Lycanthropy as an Affliction
When a character contracts lycanthropy through a werewolf’s attack, no symptoms appear until the first night of the next full moon. On that night, the afflicted character involuntarily assumes animal form and becomes a ravenous beast, forgetting his or her own identity. The character remains in animal form until dawn and remembers nothing about the incident.
Thereafter, the character is subject to involuntary transformation under the full moon and whenever damaged in combat. He or she feels an overwhelming rage building up and must succeed on a Control Shape check to resist changing into animal form.

Curing Lycanthropy
An afflicted character who eats a sprig of belladonna (also called wolfsbane) within an hour of a lycanthrope’s attack can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 20) to shake off the affliction. If someone with ranks in the Treat Injury skill administers the herb, use the character’s saving throw or the healer’s Treat Injury check, whichever is higher. The character gets only one chance, no matter how much belladonna is consumed. The belladonna must be reasonably fresh (picked within the last week).
Fresh or not, belladonna is toxic. A character consuming the herb must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 13) or take initial damage of 1d6 points of temporary Strength. One minute later, the character must succeed on a second save (same DC) or take an additional 2d6 points of temporary Strength damage.
The only other way to remove the curse of lycanthropy is to cast remove curse or break enchantment on the character during one of the three days of the full moon. After receiving the spell, the character must succeed on a Will save (DC 20) to break the curse (the caster knows whether the spell works). Otherwise, the process must be repeated. Characters undergoing this cure are often kept bound or confined in cages until the cure takes effect.
Only afflicted lycanthropes can be cured of lycanthropy. Natural lycanthropy cannot be cured.

New Skill: Control Shape (Wis) Trained Only
Any character who has contracted lycanthropy and is aware of his or her condition can learn Control Shape as a class skill. This determines whether the afflicted werewolf can voluntarily control his shape. Natural lycanthropes have control over their shapeshifting abilities.
Check: The afflicted character must make a check at moonrise each night of the full moon to resist involuntarily assuming animal form. An injured character must also check for an involuntary change after accumulating enough damage to reduce his or her hit point total to three-quarters of its full normal value and again after each additional one-quarter lost (save DC same as for full moon).

TaskDCResist involuntary change25Return to humanoid form (full moon 1)25Return to humanoid form (not full moon)20Voluntary change (full moon)10Voluntary change (not full moon)151 For game purposes, the full moon lasts three days every month.Try Again?: Check for an involuntary change once each time a triggering event occurs. On a failed check to return to humanoid form (see below), the character must remain in animal or hybrid form until the next dawn, when he or she automatically returns to humanoid form.
Special: A character can take 10, but cannot take 20.
When returning to normal form after an involuntary change, the character attempts a Wisdom check (DC 15) to realize what has happened. If the check succeeds, the character becomes aware of the affliction and can now voluntarily attempt to change to animal or hybrid form, using the appropriate DC. An attempt is a standard action and can be made each round. Any voluntary change to animal or hybrid form immediately and permanently changes the character’s two strongest allegiances to chaos and evil.
An afflicted character who is aware of his or her condition can also try to return to humanoid from after assuming animal or hybrid form, using the appropriate DC. Only one attempt is allowed, however, as described above.
Time: Attempting to control one’s shape is a full-round action.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a wyrm must hit with both claw attacks. If it gets a hold, it hangs on and stings. If a wyrm grabs a creature two or more size categories smaller, it automatically deals damage with both claws and its sting each round the hold is maintained. See Improved Grab.
Fling (Ex): A wyrm can drop a creature it has grabbed or use an attack action to fling it aside. A flung creature travels 30 feet and takes 3d6 points of damage. If the wyrm flings it while flying, the creature takes this amount or falling damage, whichever is greater.
Poison (Ex): A creature stung by a wyrm must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 25) or take 2d6 points of temporary Constitution damage. After 1 minute has elapsed, the creature must succeed on a second save (DC 25) or take another 2d6 points of temporary Constitution damage.

Zombie (Template)
Zombies do not speak, but they understand the orders of their creators.
Template Traits
 “Zombie” is a template that can be added to any corporeal creature other than an undead (referred to hereafter as the base creature. It uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
Challenge Rating: A zombie’s challenge rating depends on its size: Tiny or smaller 1/8, Small 1/4, Medium-size 1/2, Large 3, Huge 6, Gargantuan 10, Colossal  13.
Type: The creature’s type changes to undead.
Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice gained from experience, double the number of Hit Dice left, and raise them to d12.
Speed: If the base creature could fly, its maneuverability rating as a zombie drops to clumsy.
Defense: A zombie’s natural armor bonus to Defense increases to a value based on the zombie’s size (but use the base creature’s natural armor bonus, if it’s higher): Tiny or smaller +0, Small +1, Medium-size +2, Large +3, Huge +4, Gargantuan +7, Colossal +11.
Attacks: The zombie retains all the natural attacks and manufactured weapons of the base creature, but loses any weapon proficiency feats. A zombie also gains a slam attack.
Damage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A slam attack deals damage depending on the zombie’s size (but use the base creature’s slam damage if it’s greater): Fine 1, Diminutive 1d2, Tiny 1d3, Small 1d4, Medium-size 1d6, Large 1d8, Huge 2d6, Gargantuan 2d8, Colossal 4d6.
For purposes of Strength bonuses to damage, a slam attack is considered a two-handed attack.
Special Qualities: A zombie loses all of the base creature’s supernatural and spell-like qualities except for immunity or resistance to specific energy types. A zombie may retain any or all of the base creature’s extraordinary abilities, at the GM’s discretion. In addition to gaining the undead type, a zombie has the following special quality:
Move or Attack Action Only (Ex): A zombie has poor reflexes and can perform only a single move action or attack action on its turn. It can only move and attack if it charges.
Allegiances: A zombie loses any previous allegiances and adopts a new allegiance to its creator. This allegiance cannot be broken.
Saves: A zombie’s saving throw modifiers are based on Hit Dice and given in Table 8–2: Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses.
Action Points: A zombie does not acquire or amass action points. It loses any action points gained by the base creature.
Reputation Bonus: A zombie has a +0 Reputation bonus.
Ability Scores: A zombie’s ability scores change as follows: Str +2, Dex –2. Additionally, it has no Constitution or Intelligence score, its Wisdom changes to 10, and its Charisma decreases to 1.
Skills: The zombie loses all skills.
Feats: The zombie loses all of the base creature’s feats and gains the Toughness feat.

Researching Creatures
Researching a creature and learning its weaknesses will increase the likelihood of victory in the ultimate confrontation.
A hero can uncover secrets about a particular creature or type of creature through research. The success of any such endeavor is measured with Research skill checks.
Researching a creature takes 1d4 hours plus an additional 1d4 hours if the creature is unique or has traits unlike other members of its species. The type of information gleaned in this amount of time depends on the hero’s Research check result, as shown below.

Type of InformationResearch Check DCType TraitsReveals a creature’s type and any traits common to that type.15Species TraitsReveals a specific creature’s Species Traits.20Unique TraitsReveals the unique attributes and weaknesses (if any) of a specific creature.25

Creature Weaknesses
Although a creature’s type and species determine many of its traits and abilities, GMs are encouraged to alter a creature’s physiology, behavior, abilities, tactics, and defenses when it serves the story or to confound players who think they know everything about their opponents. 
The rules provided allow GMs to build custom monsters and ascribe special qualities to them. When designing a creature, the GM should also think of ways the creature can be defeated.  From the heroes’ point of view, a creature’s weaknesses are more important than its abilities.  Assigning weaknesses to creatures gives under-powered or poorly equipped heroes a fighting chance.
Table: Sources of Weakness lists many sources to which a creature may be vulnerable. A source can be a specific object, location, substance, sound, sensation, or activity. How the creature interacts with a source of weakness is left up to the GM, although most sources must be in close proximity to the creature (if not touching the creature) to affect it. GMs may roll randomly on the table, choose a source that suits the creature, or devise their own.

Source Effects
After determining a creature’s source of weakness, the GM needs to decide how the creature reacts when confronted by the source.  Pick an effect that seems appropriate for the creature and the source.
A creature gets either a Fortitude or Will saving throw to overcome or resist the source of weakness; the DC of the save varies depending on the source’s strength:
Strength of SourceSave DCEasily resistible10Moderate15Strong20Overpowering25
Creatures usually react to a source of weakness in one of six ways:
Addiction: The creature is compelled to ingest, imbibe, or inhale the source. The source must be within 5 feet of the creature to affect it. On a successful Will save, the creature negates the compulsion. On a failed save, the creature spends a full-round action indulging its addiction, then may resume normal actions while suffering one or more of the following effects (GM’s choice):
• Creature takes a –2 penalty to Dexterity and Wisdom.
• Creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks.
• Creature loses 10% of its current hit points.
• Blindness: The creature has a 50% miss chance in combat, loses any Dexterity bonus to Defense, moves at half speed, takes a –4 penalty on Strength and Dexterity-based skills, and cannot make Spot checks. Foes gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls to hit the creature.
• Deafness: The creature takes a –4 penalty to initiative checks and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components. The creature cannot make Listen checks.
• Creature loses one of its extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like special qualities.
Each effect lasts 1d4 hours. Even creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are susceptible to a source-induced addiction.
Attraction: The creature is compelled to move as fast as it can toward the source. On a successful Will save, the creature resists the compulsion. On a failed save, the creature moves toward the source at its maximum speed, taking the safest and most direct route. Once it reaches the source, the compelled creature seeks to possess it. If the source isn’t something the creature can easily possess, it gets a new save every round to break the compulsion.
Even creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are susceptible to a source-induced attraction.
Aversion: The creature finds the source repellant. On a failed save, the creature cannot approach or remain within 1d4 x10 feet of it. In the case of traveling sounds, the creature moves away from the source as fast as it can, stopping only when it can no longer hear it. On a successful Will save, the creature overcomes its aversion and may approach the source freely.
A repelled creature that cannot move the requisite distance from the source suffers one or more of the following effects (GM’s choice):
• Creature takes a –2 morale penalty to Strength and Dexterity.
• Creature takes a –2 morale penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks.
• Creature takes a –2 penalty to Defense.
• Blindness: See Addiction, above.
• Deafness: See Addiction, above.
• Creature loses one of its extraordinary, supernatural or spell-like special qualities.
Each effect lasts until the creature leaves the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Even creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are susceptible to a source-induced aversion.
Fascination: The creature finds the source fascinating and ceases all attacks and movement upon seeing, hearing, smelling, or otherwise perceiving it. On a successful Will save, the creature negates the fascination and can act normally. On a failed Will save, the creature can take no actions, and foes gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against the creature. Any time the creature is attacked or takes damage, it gets a new save to negate the fascination. Otherwise, the fascination lasts as long as the creature can see, hear, smell, or otherwise perceive the source.
Even creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are susceptible to a source-induced fascination.
Fear: The creature is frightened by the source. If it fails its Will save, the creature flees from the source as fast as it can. If unable to flee, the creature takes a –2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws. On a successful save, the creature overcomes the fear and can approach the source or otherwise act without penalty.
Even creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are susceptible to a source-induced fear.
Harm: Contact with the source or proximity to the source harms the creature in some fashion. On a successful Fortitude save, the creature negates the effect or, in the case of instant death or disintegration, takes damage instead. GMs may choose one of the following effects or invent their own:
• Blindness and deafness: See Addiction, above. The blindness and deafness last 1d4 hours.
• Creature loses all of its supernatural and spell-like special qualities.
• Creature is turned to stone instantly.
• Creature loses 50% of its current hit points.
• Creature drops dead. On a successful save, the creature takes 3d6+15 points of damage instead.
• Creature is disintegrated. On a successful save, the creature takes 5d6 points of damage instead.
Even creatures immune to effects that require Fortitude saves are susceptible to source-induced harm.
